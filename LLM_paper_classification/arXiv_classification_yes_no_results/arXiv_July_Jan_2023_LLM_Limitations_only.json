        "summary": "High-demand LLM inference services (e.g., ChatGPT and BARD) support a wide\nrange of requests from short chat conversations to long document reading. To\nensure that all client requests are processed fairly, most major LLM inference\nservices have request rate limits, to ensure that no client can dominate the\nrequest queue. However, this rudimentary notion of fairness also results in\nunder-utilization of the resources and poor client experience when there is\nspare capacity. While there is a rich literature on fair scheduling, serving\nLLMs presents new challenges due to their unpredictable request lengths and\ntheir unique batching characteristics on parallel accelerators. This paper\nintroduces the definition of LLM serving fairness based on a cost function that\naccounts for the number of input and output tokens processed. To achieve\nfairness in serving, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm, the Virtual Token\nCounter (VTC), a fair scheduler based on the continuous batching mechanism. We\nprove a 2x tight upper bound on the service difference between two backlogged\nclients, adhering to the requirement of work-conserving. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of VTC in ensuring\nfairness, especially in contrast to other baseline methods, which exhibit\nshortcomings under various conditions.",

Their self-assessments based on the Big Five\nInventory (BFI) questionnaire serve as the ground truth. We compare the\npersonality trait estimations made by ChatGPT against those by human raters and\nreport ChatGPT's competitive performance in inferring personality traits from\ntext. We also uncover a 'positivity bias' in ChatGPT's assessments across all\npersonality dimensions and explore the impact of prompt composition on\naccuracy. This work contributes to the understanding of AI capabilities in\npsychological assessment, highlighting both the potential and limitations of\nusing large language models for personality inference. Our research underscores\nthe importance of responsible AI development, considering ethical implications\nsuch as privacy, consent, autonomy, and bias in AI applications.",

        "summary": "(Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural\nlanguage summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a key role in\nhelping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with the\nsuccessful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields,\nsoftware engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve\ncode summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction\nprompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction prompting\ninvolves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selecting\nappropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to have\nprofessional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high\ntraining costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for\ncode summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can\ngenerate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code\nsummarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous\nprompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to\nunderstand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the\nprompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources.\nWe evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multiple\nprogramming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms\ninstruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some base\nLLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even\noutperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the\ntraining efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning\nscheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of the\nhuman evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summaries\ncompared to baselines.",

Removing model components is perceived as a\nsolution to tackle the large model sizes, however, existing pruning methods\nsolely focus on performance, without considering an essential aspect for the\nresponsible use of LLMs: model fairness. It is crucial to address the fairness\nof LLMs towards diverse groups, such as women, Black people, LGBTQ+, Jewish\ncommunities, among others, as they are being deployed and available to a wide\naudience. In this work, first, we investigate how attention heads impact\nfairness and performance in pre-trained transformer-based language models. We\nthen propose a novel method to prune the attention heads that negatively impact\nfairness while retaining the heads critical for performance, i.e. language\nmodeling capabilities. Our approach is practical in terms of time and\nresources, as it does not require fine-tuning the final pruned, and fairer,\nmodel. Our findings demonstrate a reduction in gender bias by 19%, 19.5%,\n39.5%, 34.7%, 23%, and 8% for DistilGPT-2, GPT-2, GPT-Neo of two different\nsizes, GPT-J, and Llama 2 models, respectively, in comparison to the biased\nmodel, with only a slight decrease in performance.",

Simple yet effective methods like Iterative Magnitude Pruning\n(IMP, Han et al., 2015) remove less important parameters and require a costly\nretraining procedure to recover performance after pruning. However, with the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining has become infeasible due\nto memory and compute constraints. In this study, we challenge the practice of\nretraining all parameters by demonstrating that updating only a small subset of\nhighly expressive parameters is often sufficient to recover or even improve\nperformance compared to full retraining. Surprisingly, retraining as little as\n0.27%-0.35% of the parameters of GPT-architectures achieves comparable\nperformance to One Shot IMP across various sparsity levels. Our approach,\nParameter-Efficient Retraining after Pruning (PERP), drastically reduces\ncompute and memory demands, enabling pruning and retraining of up to 30 billion\nparameter models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within minutes.

Due to the\ndynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been explored\nto update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-training\nor fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs to\nprovide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts a\nmix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning tasks\nsequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflict\nchecking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of these\nfunctionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehending\nand answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task of\nconflict checking.

To address these issues, we present a divide-and-conquer framework\nnamed PRO-Motion, which consists of three modules as motion planner,\nposture-diffuser and go-diffuser.

LLMs exhibit constrained memory retention across sequential\ninteractions, hindering complex reasoning. This paper explores the potential of\napplying cognitive psychology's working memory frameworks, to enhance LLM\narchitecture. The limitations of traditional LLM memory designs are analyzed,\nincluding their isolation of distinct dialog episodes and lack of persistent\nmemory links. To address this, an innovative model is proposed incorporating a\ncentralized Working Memory Hub and Episodic Buffer access to retain memories\nacross episodes. This architecture aims to provide greater continuity for\nnuanced contextual reasoning during intricate tasks and collaborative\nscenarios. While promising, further research is required into optimizing\nepisodic memory encoding, storage, prioritization, retrieval, and security.\nOverall, this paper provides a strategic blueprint for developing LLM agents\nwith more sophisticated, human-like memory capabilities, highlighting memory\nmechanisms as a vital frontier in artificial general intelligence.",

A\nprototypical QFS pipeline consists of a retriever (sparse or dense retrieval)\nand a generator (usually a large language model). However, applying large\nlanguage models (LLM) potentially leads to hallucinations, especially when the\nevidence contradicts the prior belief of LLMs. There has been growing interest\nin developing new decoding methods to improve generation quality and reduce\nhallucination. In this work, we conduct a large-scale reproducibility study on\none recently proposed decoding method -- Context-aware Decoding (CAD). In\naddition to replicating CAD's experiments on news summarization datasets, we\ninclude experiments on QFS datasets, and conduct more rigorous analysis on\ncomputational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. Experiments with eight\ndifferent language models show that performance-wise, CAD improves QFS quality\nby (1) reducing factuality errors/hallucinations while (2) mostly retaining the\nmatch of lexical patterns, measured by ROUGE scores, while also at a cost of\nincreased inference-time FLOPs and reduced decoding speed.

In this paper, we introduce LiDAR-LLM, which takes raw\nLiDAR data as input and harnesses the remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nto gain a comprehensive understanding of outdoor 3D scenes. The central insight\nof our LiDAR-LLM is the reformulation of 3D outdoor scene cognition as a\nlanguage modeling problem, encompassing tasks such as 3D captioning, 3D\ngrounding, 3D question answering, etc. Specifically, due to the scarcity of 3D\nLiDAR-text pairing data, we introduce a three-stage training strategy and\ngenerate relevant datasets, progressively aligning the 3D modality with the\nlanguage embedding space of LLM. Furthermore, we design a View-Aware\nTransformer (VAT) to connect the 3D encoder with the LLM, which effectively\nbridges the modality gap and enhances the LLM's spatial orientation\ncomprehension of visual features. Our experiments show that LiDAR-LLM possesses\nfavorable capabilities to comprehend various instructions regarding 3D scenes\nand engage in complex spatial reasoning.

We assessed Generative\nPretrained Transformer 4's (GPT-4) performance, nondeterminism, and drift to\ninform its suitability for use in complex clinical processes. Methods. A\n2-prompt process for classification of functional evidence was optimized using\na development set of 45 articles. The prompts asked GPT-4 to supply all\nfunctional data present in an article related to a variant or indicate that no\nfunctional evidence is present. For articles indicated as containing functional\nevidence, a second prompt asked GPT-4 to classify the evidence into pathogenic,\nbenign, or intermediate/inconclusive categories. A final test set of 72\nmanually classified articles was used to test performance. Results. Over a\n2.5-month period (Dec 2023-Feb 2024), we observed substantial differences in\nintraday (nondeterminism) and across day (drift) results, which lessened after\n1/18/24. This variability is seen within and across models in the GPT-4 series,\naffecting different performance statistics to different degrees. Twenty runs\nafter 1/18/24 identified articles containing functional evidence with 92.2%\nsensitivity, 95.6% positive predictive value (PPV) and 86.3% negative\npredictive value (NPV). The second prompt's identified pathogenic functional\nevidence with 90.0% sensitivity, 74.0% PPV and 95.3% NVP and for benign\nevidence with 88.0% sensitivity, 76.6% PPV and 96.9% NVP. Conclusion.\nNondeterminism and drift within LLMs must be assessed and monitored when\nintroducing LLM based functionality into clinical workflows. Failing to do this\nassessment or accounting for these challenges could lead to incorrect or\nmissing information that is critical for patient care. The performance of our\nprompts appears adequate to assist in article prioritization but not in\nautomated decision making.",

Updating knowledge via\nfine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so\nknowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative\nto inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has\nbeen considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively\nfocuses on the monolingual setting, typically in English. However, what happens\nif the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query\nthe LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual\nknowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor\n(ReMaKE) to update new knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can perform model-agnostic\nknowledge editing in multilingual settings. ReMaKE concatenates the new\nknowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with prompts. Our\nexperimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing\nmethods by a significant margin and is the first KE method to work in a\nmultilingual setting. We provide our multilingual knowledge editing dataset\n(MzsRE) in 12 languages, which along with code, and additional project\ninformation is available at https://github.com/Vicky-Wil/ReMaKE.",

We propose two techniques: (1) pronoun tokenization parity, a\nmethod to enforce consistent tokenization across gendered pronouns, and (2)\nutilizing pre-existing LLM pronoun knowledge to improve neopronoun proficiency.\nOur proposed methods outperform finetuning with standard BPE, improving\nneopronoun accuracy from 14.1% to 58.4%.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a spatial\nontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot\noperation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an\nontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second,\nwe leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic\nTensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., \"a beach contains\nsand\"), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus\nreducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even\nallowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a\nvariety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and\nshow that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene\ngraph generation with sparsely annotated data.",

We provide a comprehensive study that includes prompting variants,\ndomain shift, fine-tuned pretrained language models of varying parameter size\nand training data volumes, contrasted with both zero-shot and few-shot\napproaches on instruction-tuned language models. Although the latter were\nmarkedly outperformed by fine-tuned models, they may constitute a reasonable\noff-the-shelf alternative. Our results provide a fine-grained analysis of the\npotential and limitations of large language models for SPRP, with significant\nimprovements achievable using relatively small amounts of training data and\nmodel parameters overall, and remaining limitations for all models on the task.",

Transferring\nestablished data poisoning attacks directly to few-shot prompt tuning presents\nmultiple challenges.

It freezes the backbone model and forces a portion of LoRAs to\nfocus on leveraging world knowledge to solve downstream tasks, to alleviate\nworld knowledge-edge forgetting. Experimental results show that, as the\ninstruction data increases, LoRAMoE can significantly improve the ability to\nprocess downstream tasks, while maintaining the world knowledge stored in the\nLLM.",

We posed the same question about\nhigh-profile political issues in the United States and China to GPT in both\nEnglish and simplified Chinese, and our analysis of the bilingual responses\nrevealed that GPT's bilingual models' political \"knowledge\" (content) and the\npolitical \"attitude\" (sentiment) are significantly more inconsistent on\npolitical issues in China. The simplified Chinese GPT models not only tended to\nprovide pro-China information but also presented the least negative sentiment\ntowards China's problems, whereas the English GPT was significantly more\nnegative towards China. This disparity may stem from Chinese state censorship\nand US-China geopolitical tensions, which influence the training corpora of GPT\nbilingual models. Moreover, both Chinese and English models tended to be less\ncritical towards the issues of \"their own\" represented by the language used,\nthan the issues of \"the other.\" This suggests that GPT multilingual models\ncould potentially develop a \"political identity\" and an associated sentiment\nbias based on their training language.

Hidden context refers to data that affects the\nfeedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a\npreference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as\nhaving human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that\nresult in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according\nto different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference\nlearning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),\nimplicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule\ncalled Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are\nvery different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected\nutility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning\nfrom users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A\nkey implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to\nmisreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to\nvulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these\nproblems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference\nlearning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values\nfor each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.\nExperimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots\nidentifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent\njailbreak vulnerability.

One\npossibility is that the temperatures in the reports match the mean and variance\nof reports from 2023 (i.e. matching the statistics of pretraining). Another\npossibility is that the reports predict higher temperatures, by incorporating\ndeclarative statements about climate change from scientific papers written in\n2023. An example of such a declarative statement is \"global temperatures will\nincrease by $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ by 2050\".\n  To test the influence of abstract declarative statements, we construct tasks\nin which LLMs are finetuned on both declarative and procedural information. We\nfind that declarative statements influence model predictions, even when they\nconflict with procedural information. In particular, finetuning on a\ndeclarative statement $S$ increases the model likelihood for logical\nconsequences of $S$. The effect of declarative statements is consistent across\nthree domains: aligning an AI assistant, predicting weather, and predicting\ndemographic features. Through a series of ablations, we show that the effect of\ndeclarative statements cannot be explained by associative learning based on\nmatching keywords. Nevertheless, the effect of declarative statements on model\nlikelihoods is small in absolute terms and increases surprisingly little with\nmodel size (i.e. from 330 million to 175 billion parameters). We argue that\nthese results have implications for AI risk (in relation to the \"treacherous\nturn\") and for fairness.",

This paper tackles the\nchallenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity\nby storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to\nDRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into\naccount the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two\ncritical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading\ndata in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed\nframework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \"windowing\"\nstrategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons,\nand second, \"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access\nstrengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash\nmemory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size\nof the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed\ncompared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our\nintegration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a\nhardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on\ndevices with limited memory.",

Re-training\nfrom scratch is impractical and has led to the creation of the 'unlearning'\ndiscipline where models are modified to \"unlearn\" undesirable information\nwithout retraining. However, any modification can alter the behaviour of LLMs,\nespecially on key dimensions such as fairness. This is the first work that\nexamines this interplay between unlearning and fairness for LLMs. In\nparticular, we focus on a popular unlearning framework known as SISA [Bourtoule\net al., 2021], which creates an ensemble of models trained on disjoint shards.\nWe evaluate the performance-fairness trade-off for SISA, and empirically\ndemsontrate that SISA can indeed reduce fairness in LLMs. To remedy this, we\npropose post-processing bias mitigation techniques for ensemble models produced\nby SISA. We adapt the post-processing fairness improvement technique from\n[Hardt et al., 2016] to design three methods that can handle model ensembles,\nand prove that one of the methods is an optimal fair predictor for ensemble of\nmodels.

The capacity of LLMs to present erroneous answers in a coherent and\nsemantically rigorous manner further complicates the detection of factual\ninaccuracies. This issue is especially pronounced in fields that require\nspecialized expertise. Our work delves into these challenges, aiming to enhance\nthe understanding and mitigation of such errors, thereby contributing to the\nimprovement of LLM accuracy and reliability in scientific and other specialized\ndomains. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between the context's\nrelevancy and the answers' measured quality. In addition, we demonstrate that\nwith the correct calibration, it is possible to automate the grading procedure\n-- a finding suggesting that, at least to some degree, the LLMs can be used to\nself-examine the quality of their own performance.

This task\nis crucial for alleviating the hallucination problem encountered by large\nlanguage models. Given the lack of paired data (i.e., false claims and their\ncorresponding correct claims), existing methods typically adopt the\nmask-then-correct paradigm. This paradigm relies solely on unpaired false\nclaims and correct claims, thus being referred to as distantly supervised\nmethods. These methods require a masker to explicitly identify factual errors\nwithin false claims before revising with a corrector. However, the absence of\npaired data to train the masker makes accurately pinpointing factual errors\nwithin claims challenging. To mitigate this, we propose to improve FEC by\nLearning to Inject Factual Errors (LIFE), a three-step distantly supervised\nmethod: mask-corrupt-correct. Specifically, we first train a corruptor using\nthe mask-then-corrupt procedure, allowing it to deliberately introduce factual\nerrors into correct text. The corruptor is then applied to correct claims,\ngenerating a substantial amount of paired data. After that, we filter out\nlow-quality data, and use the remaining data to train a corrector. Notably, our\ncorrector does not require a masker, thus circumventing the bottleneck\nassociated with explicit factual error identification. Our experiments on a\npublic dataset verify the effectiveness of LIFE in two key aspects: Firstly, it\noutperforms the previous best-performing distantly supervised method by a\nnotable margin of 10.59 points in SARI Final (19.3% improvement). Secondly,\neven compared to ChatGPT prompted with in-context examples, LIFE achieves a\nsuperiority of 7.16 points in SARI Final.",

Specifically, we utilize keywords to train a deep\nlearning architecture that outperforms a language model pretrained on a large\ncorpus of text. Our proposal does not require pretraining nor fine-tuning and\ncan be applied directly to a specific setting for performing multi-label\nclassification. Our objective is to automatically assign a new patient to the\nspecialty of the medical professional they require, using a dataset that\ncontains medical transcriptions and relevant keywords. To this end, we\nfine-tune the PubMedBERT model on this dataset, which serves as the baseline\nfor our experiments. We then twice train/fine-tune a DNN and the RoBERTa\nlanguage model, using both the keywords and the full transcriptions as input.\nWe compare the performance of these approaches using relevant metrics. Our\nresults demonstrate that utilizing keywords for text classification\nsignificantly improves classification performance, for both a basic DL\narchitecture and a large language model. Our approach represents a promising\nand efficient alternative to traditional methods for finetuning language models\non domain-specific data and has potential applications in various medical\ndomains",

While the WVS is accepted as an explicit assessment of values, we\nlack methods for assessing implicit moral and cultural values in media, e.g.,\nencountered in social media, political rhetoric, narratives, and generated by\nAI systems such as LLMs that are increasingly present in our daily lives. As we\nconsume online content and utilize LLM outputs, we might ask, which moral\nvalues are being implicitly promoted or undercut, or -- in the case of LLMs --\nif they are intending to represent a cultural identity, are they doing so\nconsistently? In this paper we utilize a Recognizing Value Resonance (RVR) NLP\nmodel to identify WVS values that resonate and conflict with a given passage of\noutput text. We apply RVR to the text generated by LLMs to characterize\nimplicit moral values, allowing us to quantify the moral/cultural distance\nbetween LLMs and various demographics that have been surveyed using the WVS. In\nline with other work we find that LLMs exhibit several Western-centric value\nbiases; they overestimate how conservative people in non-Western countries are,\nthey are less accurate in representing gender for non-Western countries, and\nportray older populations as having more traditional values.

Emerging\nlarge language models (LLMs) provide a previously impossible opportunity to\nautomatically translate a task description in a natural language to a program\nthat can be executed by the drone. However, powerful LLMs and their vision\ncounterparts are limited in three important ways. First, they are only\navailable as cloud-based services. Sending images to the cloud raises privacy\nconcerns. Second, they are expensive, costing proportionally to the request\nsize. Finally, without expensive fine-tuning, existing LLMs are quite limited\nin their capability of writing a program for specialized systems like drones.\n  In this paper, we present a system called TypeFly that tackles the above\nthree problems using a combination of edge-based vision intelligence, novel\nprogramming language design, and prompt engineering. Instead of the familiar\nPython, TypeFly gets a cloud-based LLM service to write a program in a small,\ncustom language called MiniSpec, based on task and scene descriptions in\nEnglish. Such MiniSpec programs are not only succinct (and therefore efficient)\nbut also able to consult the LLM during their execution using a special skill\ncalled query. Using a set of increasingly challenging drone tasks, we show that\ndesign choices made by TypeFly can reduce both the cost of LLM service and the\ntask execution time by more than 2x. More importantly, query and prompt\nengineering techniques contributed by TypeFly significantly improve the chance\nof success of complex tasks.",

By compensating an\nattention trough of a particular process with an attention peak of another\nprocess, our approach enhances LLM's awareness to various contextual positions,\nthus mitigating the risk of overlooking crucial information.

Using data from 129,228 emergency room visits, we train a model to\nidentify notes written by fatigued physicians -- those who worked 5 or more of\nthe prior 7 days. In a hold-out set, the model accurately identifies notes\nwritten by these high-workload physicians, and also flags notes written in\nother high-fatigue settings: on overnight shifts, and after high patient\nvolumes. Model predictions also correlate with worse decision-making on at\nleast one important metric: yield of testing for heart attack is 18% lower with\neach standard deviation increase in model-predicted fatigue. Finally, the model\nindicates that notes written about Black and Hispanic patients have 12% and 21%\nhigher predicted fatigue than Whites -- larger than overnight vs. daytime\ndifferences. These results have an important implication for large language\nmodels (LLMs). Our model indicates that fatigued doctors write more predictable\nnotes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, because word prediction is the core of how LLMs\nwork, we find that LLM-written notes have 17% higher predicted fatigue than\nreal physicians' notes. This indicates that LLMs may introduce distortions in\ngenerated text that are not yet fully understood.",

Recent work shows promise by\ndecomposing such tasks using a large language model (LLM) into an executable\nprogram that invokes specialized vision models. However, generated programs are\nerror-prone: they omit necessary steps, include spurious ones, and are unable\nto recover when the specialized models give incorrect outputs. Moreover, they\nrequire loading multiple models, incurring high latency and computation costs.\nWe propose Visual Program Distillation (VPD), an instruction tuning framework\nthat produces a vision-language model (VLM) capable of solving complex visual\ntasks with a single forward pass. VPD distills the reasoning ability of LLMs by\nusing them to sample multiple candidate programs, which are then executed and\nverified to identify a correct one. It translates each correct program into a\nlanguage description of the reasoning steps, which are then distilled into a\nVLM. Extensive experiments show that VPD improves the VLM's ability to count,\nunderstand spatial relations, and reason compositionally. Our VPD-trained\nPaLI-X outperforms all prior VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nacross complex vision tasks, including MMBench, OK-VQA, A-OKVQA, TallyQA, POPE,\nand Hateful Memes. An evaluation with human annotators also confirms that VPD\nimproves model response factuality and consistency.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose GroundedBERT - a grounded language learning method that\nenhances the BERT representation with visually grounded information.\nGroundedBERT comprises two components: (i) the original BERT which captures the\ncontextual representation of words learned from the language corpora, and (ii)\na visual grounding module which captures visual information learned from\nvisual-grounded datasets.

In NLP, text\nclassification problems have garnered considerable focus, but still faced with\nsome limitations related to expensive computational cost, time consumption, and\nrobust performance to unseen classes. With the proposal of chain of thought\nprompting (CoT), LLMs can be implemented using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with\nthe step by step reasoning prompts, instead of conventional question and answer\nformats. The zero-shot LLMs in the text classification problems can alleviate\nthese limitations by directly utilizing pretrained models to predict both seen\nand unseen classes. Our research primarily validates the capability of GPT\nmodels in text classification. We focus on effectively utilizing prompt\nstrategies to various text classification scenarios. Besides, we compare the\nperformance of zero shot LLMs with other state of the art text classification\nmethods, including traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods,\nand ZSL methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of LLMs\nunderscores their effectiveness as zero-shot text classifiers in three of the\nfour datasets analyzed.

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the main\nparadigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nTypically, RLHF involves the initial step of learning a reward model from human\nfeedback, often expressed as preferences between pairs of text generations\nproduced by a pre-trained LLM. Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned by\noptimizing it to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learning\nalgorithm. However, an inherent limitation of current reward models is their\ninability to fully represent the richness of human preferences and their\ndependency on the sampling distribution.\n  In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of\nLLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learning\nof a preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs given a prompt,\nfollowed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses\npreferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash\nequilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning from\nhuman feedback (NLHF).\n  In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novel\nalgorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent.\nThis algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration\nconverging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore\nparametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descent\nalgorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of a\nLLM for a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue\nfor preference learning and policy optimization with the potential of advancing\nthe field of aligning LLMs with human preferences.",

However, such large models are susceptible to\noverfitting to their training data, and as a result the models perform poorly\nwhen the domain changes. Also, due to the model's scale, the cost of\nfine-tuning the model to the new domain is large. Nonparametric Variational\nInformation Bottleneck (NVIB) has been proposed as a regulariser for training\ncross-attention in Transformers, potentially addressing the overfitting\nproblem. We extend the NVIB framework to replace all types of attention\nfunctions in Transformers, and show that existing pretrained Transformers can\nbe reinterpreted as Nonparametric Variational (NV) models using a proposed\nidentity initialisation. We then show that changing the initialisation\nintroduces a novel, information-theoretic post-training regularisation in the\nattention mechanism, which improves out-of-domain generalisation without any\ntraining. This success supports the hypothesis that pretrained Transformers are\nimplicitly NV Bayesian models.",

PoseGPT\naddresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token\nwithin a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both\ntextual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction\nbut also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human\nposes, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning\nabout pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate\n3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish\nbenchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and\nestimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing\nmultimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks.\nFurthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based\non complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.",

Recent advancement in large language models\n(LLMs) has shown great reasoning abilities to solve complex problems. In this\nstudy, we propose to use LLMs to predict travel behavior with prompt\nengineering without data-based parameter learning. Specifically, we carefully\ndesign our prompts that include 1) task description, 2) travel characteristics,\n3) individual attributes, and 4) guides of thinking with domain knowledge, and\nask the LLMs to predict an individual's travel behavior and explain the\nresults. We select the travel mode choice task as a case study.

In this paper, we present\nOPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a\nRetrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate\nthe hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Our\napproach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations are\nclosely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the\nself-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a\nfew summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust\ninclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image\ncontent with hallucination. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a\npenalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate\nthe over-trust issue, along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the\npresence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate\nthe token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows\nsignificant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and\nmetrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's\nrobustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption\nresources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection\n(e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called\ndynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the\ninherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks.\nOur method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional\ncosts. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention\nrectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens,\nand (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate\ntokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly\nmitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\\% better\nperformance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The\nmodel-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with\nother defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the\nmodel's robustness.

Accurate human\nmobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as\nwell as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about\npublic events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to\nencode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing\nmethods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling\ndata sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public\nevents (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their\nunprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and\ngenerate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms\nraw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized\nformat, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and\nevent-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in\nmaking and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and\nevent features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City,\nbased on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show\nthat LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with\ntextual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers\ninterpretable insights into its predictions.

This task is crucial but\nchallenging since the LLM is trained on text modality only, making it hard to\neffectively digest the visual modality. To address this, existing methods\ntypically train a visual adapter to align the representation between a\npre-trained vision transformer (ViT) and the LLM by a generative image\ncaptioning loss. However, we find that the generative objective can only\nproduce weak alignment for vision and language, making the aligned\nvision-language model very hungry for the instruction fine-tuning data. In this\npaper, we propose CG-VLM that applies both Contrastive and Generative alignment\nobjectives to effectively align the representation of ViT and LLM. Different\nfrom image level and sentence level alignment in common contrastive learning\nsettings, CG-VLM aligns the image-patch level features and text-token level\nembeddings, which, however, is very hard to achieve as no explicit grounding\npatch-token relation provided in standard image captioning datasets. To address\nthis issue, we propose to maximize the averaged similarity between pooled\nimage-patch features and text-token embeddings.

This paper\nintroduces a novel solution, Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization\n(HA-DPO), which reframes the hallucination problem as a preference selection\ntask. The model is trained to favor the non-hallucinating response when\npresented with two responses of the same image (one accurate and one\nhallucinatory). Furthermore, this paper proposes an efficient pipeline for\nconstructing positive~(non-hallucinatory) and negative~(hallucinatory) sample\npairs, ensuring a high-quality, style-consistent dataset for robust preference\nlearning. When applied to three mainstream multimodal models, HA-DPO\nsignificantly reduced hallucination issues and amplified the models'\ngeneralization capabilities. Notably, the MiniGPT-4 model, when enhanced with\nHA-DPO, demonstrated a substantial improvement: POPE accuracy rose from 51.13%\nto 86.13% (an absolute improvement of 35%), and the MME score surged from\n932.00 to 1326.46 (a relative improvement of 42.32%).

Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler\nor interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain\nconditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior -- in other cases, the\nissue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors\ncan be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed\nby automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically\ndetecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for\nnovices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising\nperformance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining\ncode. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with\nthe next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors\nrelate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to\nanalysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two\npopular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly\nexplanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of\nintroductory computing students $(n=964)$ solving the same error detection\ntask. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we\nobserve significant improvement in logic error identification between the\nprevious and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations\nsignificantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be\nintegrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for\nsupporting students when learning programming.",

This paper aims to\nreduce the monetary cost for serving LLMs by leveraging preemptible GPU\ninstances on modern clouds, which offer accesses to spare GPUs at a much\ncheaper price than regular instances but may be preempted by the cloud at any\ntime. Serving LLMs on preemptible instances requires addressing challenges\ninduced by frequent instance preemptions and the necessity of migrating\ninstances to handle these preemptions.\n  This paper presents SpotServe, the first distributed LLM serving system on\npreemptible instances. Several key techniques in SpotServe realize fast and\nreliable serving of generative LLMs on cheap preemptible instances. First,\nSpotServe dynamically adapts the LLM parallelization configuration for dynamic\ninstance availability and fluctuating workload, while balancing the trade-off\namong the overall throughput, inference latency and monetary costs. Second, to\nminimize the cost of migrating instances for dynamic reparallelization, the\ntask of migrating instances is formulated as a bipartite graph matching\nproblem, which uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to identify an optimal migration\nplan that minimizes communications. Finally, to take advantage of the grace\nperiod offered by modern clouds, we introduce stateful inference recovery, a\nnew inference mechanism that commits inference progress at a much finer\ngranularity and allows SpotServe to cheaply resume inference upon preemption.\nWe evaluate on real spot instance preemption traces and various popular LLMs\nand show that SpotServe can reduce the P99 tail latency by 2.4 - 9.1x compared\nwith the best existing LLM serving systems. We also show that SpotServe can\nleverage the price advantage of preemptive instances, saving 54% monetary cost\ncompared with only using on-demand instances.",

While many studies have discussed governance and regulations\ndeductively from first-order principles, few studies provide an inductive,\ndata-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs\nespecially when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have\nthe potential to pose a serious threat to people. In this work, we conduct a\nuser study engaging over 40 individuals across all age groups in price\nnegotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM,\ninvestigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore,\nwe highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities\nand, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the\nLLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any\nrationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve\nspan a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting\nwith LLMs.",

To maximize the robustness of these\nrules, we develop a novel adversarial annotation mechanism.

Unfortunately, most datasets do not\ninclude self-reported gender information, making it necessary for researchers\nto infer gender from other information, such as names or names and country\ninformation. An important limitation of these tools is that they fail to\nappropriately capture the fact that gender exists on a non-binary scale,\nhowever, it remains important to evaluate and compare how well these tools\nperform in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we compare the performance of\na generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three commercially\navailable list-based and machine learning-based gender inference tools (Namsor,\nGender-API, and genderize.io) on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large\nOlympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first\nname and first and last name, with and without country information) impact the\naccuracy of their predictions. We report results for the full set, as well as\nfor the subsets: medal versus non-medal winners, athletes from the largest\nEnglish-speaking countries, and athletes from East Asia. On these sets, we find\nthat Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However,\nChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outperforms it,\nespecially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is\navailable. All tools perform better on medalists versus non-medalists and on\nnames from English-speaking countries.

It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$\ncomputation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, computing the\napproximated attention matrix $U_1U_2^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ still\nnecessitates $O(n^2)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response\nto these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of\nthe data in a streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to\nstore three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage.\nNotably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with\nsuper-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee\ndiminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant. This unique\nattribute underscores the potential of our technique in efficiently handling\nLLMs in streaming applications.",

However, they tend to\ngenerate factually incorrect reasoning steps when the required knowledge is not\navailable or up-to-date in models' parameters. Recent works turn to retrieving\nexternal knowledge to augment CoT reasoning. Despite being promising, these\nchain-based methods suffer from: 1) Negative retrieval. Unnecessary or\nincorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the\nability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate\nalong the chain.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought\nReasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query\ntree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node.\nThen, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions\nfrom leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and\nanswering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident\nanswer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA\nthat employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative\nretrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs\nhave broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from\nchild nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three\nComplex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach\noutperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of\nprobabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning.",

However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)\npretrained on extensive, multilingual and diverse text data, these limitations\nseem overcome. Nevertheless, their generalisability to different languages and\ndomains in dialogue applications remains uncertain without benchmarking\ndatasets. This paper presents a holistic annotation approach for emotion and\nconversational quality in the context of bilingual customer support\nconversations. By performing annotations that take into consideration the\ncomplete instances that compose a conversation, one can form a broader\nperspective of the dialogue as a whole. Furthermore, it provides a unique and\nvaluable resource for the development of text classification models. To this\nend, we present benchmarks for Emotion Recognition and Dialogue Quality\nEstimation and show that further research is needed to leverage these models in\na production setting.",

        "summary": "Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object\ncompositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training.\nHowever, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing\nknowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two\nkey factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the\nappearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with\ndifferent objects (or states). For instance, the state \"old\" can signify a\nvintage design for a \"car\" or an advanced age for a \"cat\". In this paper, we\nargue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition\ncategories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive\nLanguage-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better\nobservation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of\nconcepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a\nstep-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further\ndevise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing\nclassifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2)\nPLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to\ncraft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive\nablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in\ncompositional recognition.",

They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as\ncode2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when\nperforming tasks such as code summarization and identifying code\nvulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to\nadversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the\nprogram's semantics, such as the inclusion of \"dead code\" through false\nconditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to\n\"fool\" the models.

In\nthis paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on\ncoding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of\nadversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code\nmodels, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such\nadversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based\ndefenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information\nsuch as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for\nreversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial\nexamples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening\nthe LLMs' performance.

However, the hallucinations\ninherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs\nin MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various\nhallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate\nthose hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual\ninstruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors,\nwe present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework,\nHalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to\nidentify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically.\nInterestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising\nfrom long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on\nthat, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data\ndistribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations.\nComprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our\nmethod successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains\ncompetitive performance compared to LLaVA.

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities to perform reasoning tasks.\nHowever, numerous evaluations of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs have also\nshowed some limitations.

This\npotentially indicates some theoretical limitations of generalization in\nlearning reasoning skills. These evaluations and their observations motivated\nus to perform a theoretical study of the length generalization problem.

        "summary": "Retrieval augmentation has become an effective solution to empower large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with external and verified knowledge sources from the\ndatabase, which overcomes the limitations and hallucinations of LLMs in\nhandling up-to-date and domain-specific information. However, existing\nembedding models for text retrieval usually have three non-negligible\nlimitations. First, the number and diversity of samples in a batch are too\nrestricted to supervise the modeling of textual nuances at scale. Second, the\nhigh proportional noise are detrimental to the semantic correctness and\nconsistency of embeddings. Third, the equal treatment to easy and difficult\nsamples would cause sub-optimum convergence of embeddings with poorer\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose the PEG, a progressively learned\nembeddings for robust text retrieval. Specifically, we increase the training\nin-batch negative samples to 80,000, and for each query, we extracted five hard\nnegatives. Concurrently, we incorporated a progressive learning mechanism,\nenabling the model to dynamically modulate its attention to the samples\nthroughout the entire training process. Additionally, PEG is trained on more\nthan 100 million data, encompassing a wide range of domains (e.g., finance,\nmedicine, and tourism) and covering various tasks (e.g., question-answering,\nmachine reading comprehension, and similarity matching). Extensive experiments\nconducted on C-MTEB and DuReader demonstrate that PEG surpasses\nstate-of-the-art embeddings in retrieving true positives, highlighting its\nsignificant potential for applications in LLMs. Our model is publicly available\nat https://huggingface.co/TownsWu/PEG.",

The\nquantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by\ngenerating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average\ncyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines\nafter filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct.\nFurthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows outstanding capability in code\nformatting, while unnecessary behaviors such as deleting or translating\ncomments are also observed.",

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial\nprompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that mislead\nLLMs into generating incorrect or undesired outputs. Previous work has revealed\nthat with relatively simple yet effective attacks based on discrete\noptimization, it is possible to generate adversarial prompts that bypass\nmoderation and alignment of the models. This vulnerability to adversarial\nprompts underscores a significant concern regarding the robustness and\nreliability of LLMs. Our work aims to address this concern by introducing a\nnovel approach to detecting adversarial prompts at a token level, leveraging\nthe LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the\ndegree of the model's perplexity, where tokens predicted with high probability\nare considered normal, and those exhibiting high perplexity are flagged as\nadversarial. Additionaly, our method also integrates context understanding by\nincorporating neighboring token information to encourage the detection of\ncontiguous adversarial prompt sequences. To this end, we design two algorithms\nfor adversarial prompt detection: one based on optimization techniques and\nanother on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). Both methods are equipped with\nefficient solving methods, ensuring efficient adversarial prompt detection. Our\ntoken-level detection result can be visualized as heatmap overlays on the text\nsequence, allowing for a clearer and more intuitive representation of which\npart of the text may contain adversarial prompts.",

However, real-world complex systems present three\nprevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real\nsystem usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the\ndescriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited;\n(2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs\ncan hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks;\n(3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create\nchallenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them.

        "summary": "Today's robot policies exhibit subpar performance when faced with the\nchallenge of generalizing to novel environments. Human corrective feedback is a\ncrucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to\nand learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only\ndo robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right\ninformation in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they\nwould need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections\nabout high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill\nparameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online\nCorrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)-based system that can respond\nto arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from\ncorrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual\nsimilarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond\nto a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both\nhigh-level task plans and low-level skill primitives. We demonstrate that DROC\neffectively distills the relevant information from the sequence of online\ncorrections in a knowledge base and retrieves that knowledge in settings with\nnew task or object instances. DROC outperforms other techniques that directly\ngenerate robot code via LLMs by using only half of the total number of\ncorrections needed in the first round and requires little to no corrections\nafter two iterations. We show further results, videos, prompts and code on\nhttps://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/droc .",

This paper introduces a novel\napproach to enhance LLMs by effectively extracting the relevant knowledge from\ndomain-specific textual sources, and the adaptive training of a chatbot with\ndomain-specific inquiries. Our two-step approach starts from training a\nknowledge miner, namely LLMiner, which autonomously extracts Question-Answer\npairs from relevant documents through a chain-of-thought reasoning process.\nSubsequently, we blend the mined QA pairs with a conversational dataset to\nfine-tune the LLM as a chatbot, thereby enriching its domain-specific expertise\nand conversational capabilities. We also developed a new evaluation benchmark\nwhich comprises four domain-specific text corpora and associated human-crafted\nQA pairs for testing. Our model shows remarkable performance improvement over\ngenerally aligned LLM and surpasses domain-adapted models directly fine-tuned\non domain corpus. In particular, LLMiner achieves this with minimal human\nintervention, requiring only 600 seed instances, thereby providing a pathway\ntowards self-improvement of LLMs through model-synthesized training data.",

Second, while the visual\ninstruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue\nformat, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns\nare weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To\ntackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types:\ncritique and refinement. The critique NLF identifies the strengths and\nweaknesses of the responses and is used to align the LVLMs with human\npreferences. The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and\nis adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on\nLVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn\ninteractions. To address the non-differentiable nature of NLF, we generalize\nconditional reinforcement learning for training. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that DRESS can generate more helpful (9.76%), honest (11.52%), and\nharmless (21.03%) responses, and more effectively learn from feedback during\nmulti-turn interactions compared to SOTA LVMLs.",

We investigate whether large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can serve as a medium to improve health literacy in\nchildren and other populations.\n  Methods: We ran 288 conditions using 26 different prompts through\nChatGPT-3.5, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. Given constraints imposed by rate\nlimits, we tested a subset of 150 conditions through ChatGPT-4. The primary\noutcome measurements were the reading grade level (RGL) and word counts of\noutput.\n  Results: Across all models, output for basic prompts such as \"Explain\" and\n\"What is (are)\" were at, or exceeded, a 10th-grade RGL. When prompts were\nspecified to explain conditions from the 1st to 12th RGL, we found that LLMs\nhad varying abilities to tailor responses based on RGL. ChatGPT-3.5 provided\nresponses that ranged from the 7th-grade to college freshmen RGL while\nChatGPT-4 outputted responses from the 6th-grade to the college-senior RGL.\nMicrosoft Bing provided responses from the 9th to 11th RGL while Google Bard\nprovided responses from the 7th to 10th RGL.\n  Discussion: ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 did better in achieving lower-grade\nlevel outputs. Meanwhile Bard and Bing tended to consistently produce an RGL\nthat is at the high school level regardless of prompt. Additionally, Bard's\nhesitancy in providing certain outputs indicates a cautious approach towards\nhealth information. LLMs demonstrate promise in enhancing health communication,\nbut future research should verify the accuracy and effectiveness of such tools\nin this context.\n  Implications: LLMs face challenges in crafting outputs below a sixth-grade\nreading level. However, their capability to modify outputs above this threshold\nprovides a potential mechanism to improve health literacy and communication in\na pediatric population and beyond.",

In this work, we\nunify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the\nfoundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but\nrobust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images\nand videos, mutually enhancing each other.

We introduce a\nbenchmark consisting of tasks that lawyers and paralegals would expect LLMs to\nhandle zero-shot, such as looking up the text at a line of a witness deposition\nor at a subsection of a contract. LLMs' poor performance on this benchmark\ncasts into doubt their reliability as-is for legal practice. However,\nfine-tuning for these tasks brings even a smaller model to near-perfect\nperformance on our test set and also raises performance on a related legal\ntask. These results suggest that many simple behaviors needed for a domain may\nnot be present in foundational LLMs, without additional engagement from subject\nmatter experts.",

Our research is motivated by the observation that\nprevious instruction tuning methods force the model to complete a sentence no\nmatter whether the model knows the knowledge or not. When the question is out\nof the parametric knowledge, it will try to make up something and fail to\nindicate when it lacks knowledge. In this paper, we present a new approach\ncalled Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning). This approach is formalized\nby first identifying the knowledge gap between parametric knowledge and the\ninstruction tuning data. Then, we construct the refusal-aware data based on the\nknowledge intersection, to tune LLMs to refrain from responding to questions\nbeyond its parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate this new\ninstruction tuning approach effectively improves a model's ability to answer\nknown questions and refrain from answering unknown questions. Furthermore, when\ntested on out-of-domain datasets, the refusal ability was found to be a\nmeta-skill that could be generalized to other tasks. Further analysis\nsurprisingly finds that learning the uncertainty during training displays a\nbetter ability to estimate uncertainty than uncertainty-based testing.

However, learning to parse\nto rare domain-specific languages (DSLs) from just a few demonstrations is\nchallenging, limiting the performance of even the most capable LLMs. In this\nwork, we improve the effectiveness of ICL for semantic parsing by (1) using\ngeneral-purpose programming languages such as Python instead of DSLs, and (2)\naugmenting prompts with a structured domain description that includes, e.g.,\nthe available classes and functions. We show that both these changes\nsignificantly improve accuracy across three popular datasets. Combined, they\nlead to dramatic improvements (e.g. 7.9% to 66.5% on SMCalFlow compositional\nsplit), nearly closing the performance gap between easier i.i.d.\\ and harder\ncompositional splits when used with a strong model, and reducing the need for a\nlarge number of demonstrations. We find that the resemblance of the target\nparse language to general-purpose code is a more important factor than the\nlanguage's popularity in pre-training corpora. Our findings provide an improved\nmethodology for building semantic parsers in the modern context of ICL with\nLLMs.",

Pruned models yield downstream task performance comparable to\nthe original, making them ideal alternatives when operating on a limited\nbudget.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that current LLMs face challenges comprehending abstraction\nknowledge in zero-shot and few-shot settings. By training on our rich\nabstraction knowledge, we find LLMs can acquire basic abstraction abilities and\ngeneralize to unseen events.

To save our precious time, we propose a novel\nand useful method, Clean-Eval, which mitigates the issue of data contamination\nand evaluates the LLMs in a cleaner manner. Clean-Eval employs an LLM to\nparaphrase and back-translate the contaminated data into a candidate set,\ngenerating expressions with the same meaning but in different surface forms. A\nsemantic detector is then used to filter the generated low-quality samples to\nnarrow down this candidate set. The best candidate is finally selected from\nthis set based on the BLEURT score. According to human assessment, this best\ncandidate is semantically similar to the original contamination data but\nexpressed differently. All candidates can form a new benchmark to evaluate the\nmodel.

Due to the difficulty of manually enumerating all relationships\nbetween entities, automatically completing them is essential for KGs. Knowledge\nGraph Completion (KGC) is a task that infers unseen relationships between\nentities in a KG. Traditional embedding-based KGC methods, such as RESCAL,\nTransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, HousE, etc., infer missing links using\nonly the knowledge from training data. In contrast, the recent Pre-trained\nLanguage Model (PLM)-based KGC utilizes knowledge obtained during pre-training.\nTherefore, PLM-based KGC can estimate missing links between entities by reusing\nmemorized knowledge from pre-training without inference. This approach is\nproblematic because building KGC models aims to infer unseen links between\nentities. However, conventional evaluations in KGC do not consider inference\nand memorization abilities separately. Thus, a PLM-based KGC method, which\nachieves high performance in current KGC evaluations, may be ineffective in\npractical applications. To address this issue, we analyze whether PLM-based KGC\nmethods make inferences or merely access memorized knowledge. For this purpose,\nwe propose a method for constructing synthetic datasets specified in this\nanalysis and conclude that PLMs acquire the inference abilities required for\nKGC through pre-training, even though the performance improvements mostly come\nfrom textual information of entities and relations.",

While\nsignificant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs\nthrough jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of exploration into\ndefending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to\nthe success of jailbreaks: the inherent conflict between the goals of being\nhelpful and ensuring safety. To counter jailbreaking attacks, we propose to\nintegrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages.\nImplementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the\nAttack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking attacks, reducing it from 66.4% to\n2.0% for ChatGPT and from 68.2% to 19.4% for Vicuna-33B, without compromising\ngeneral performance. Furthermore, integrating the concept of goal\nprioritization into the training phase reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for\nLLama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are\nincluded during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half, decreasing it\nfrom 71.0% to 34.0%. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs\nface greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered\ntowards defending against such attacks.

Therefore, in this paper, we aim\nto explore the feasibility of this new learning paradigm, which targets on\nencoding rule-based knowledge into LLMs. We further propose rule distillation,\nwhich first uses the strong in-context abilities of LLMs to extract the\nknowledge from the textual rules, and then explicitly encode the knowledge into\nthe parameters of LLMs by learning from the above in-context signals produced\ninside the model. Our experiments show that making LLMs learn from rules by our\nmethod is much more efficient than example-based learning in both the sample\nsize and generalization ability.

We then explore using a surrogate confidence\nmodel -- using a model where we do have probabilities to evaluate the original\nmodel's confidence in a given question.

This has\ngenerally been attributed to either a fundamental inadequacy of modes in models\nor weaknesses in language modeling. Contrastingly in this work, we emphasize\nthat degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of any model error, due to\ncontamination of the training data. Specifically, we show that mixing even a\ntiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population text distribution can cause\nthe data distribution's mode to become degenerate, implying that any models\ntrained on it will be as well. As the unconditional mode of NLG models will\noften be degenerate, we therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's\ndistribution conditional on avoiding specific degeneracies. Using exact-search,\nwe empirically verify that the length-conditional modes of machine translation\nmodels and language models are indeed more fluent and topical than their\nunconditional modes. For the first time, we also share many examples of exact\nmodal sequences from these models, and from several variants of the LLaMA-7B\nmodel. Notably, the modes of the LLaMA models are still degenerate, showing\nthat improvements in modeling have not fixed this issue. Because of the cost of\nexact mode finding algorithms, we develop an approximate mode finding approach,\nACBS, which finds sequences that are both high-likelihood and high-quality. We\napply this approach to LLaMA-7B, a model which was not trained for instruction\nfollowing, and find that we are able to elicit reasonable outputs without any\nfinetuning.",

Further,\ncommon standard methods for fairness involve access to models weights or are\napplied during finetuning, which are not applicable in few-shot learning. Do\nLLMs exhibit prediction biases when used for standard NLP tasks? In this work,\nwe explore the effect of shots, which directly affect the performance of\nmodels, on the fairness of LLMs as NLP classification systems. We consider how\ndifferent shot selection strategies, both existing and new demographically\nsensitive methods, affect model fairness across three standard fairness\ndatasets. We discuss how future work can include LLM fairness evaluations.",

        "summary": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have\nled to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional\nsearch engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but\nfactually inaccurate claims, often referred to as 'hallucinations.' These\nerrors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate\nmisconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a\ntime-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In\nthis work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human\nlabeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We\nleverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent\nworks have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by\nmeasuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model's\nconfidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables\nstraightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than\nsupervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses.\nWe show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference\nrankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel\nretrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of\ngenerated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with\nRLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to\nLlama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when\ngenerating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

Recent methods\nhave endeavored to address the issue by employing a class-agnostic mask (or\nbox) proposal model, complemented by an open-vocabulary classifier (e.g., CLIP)\nusing pre-extracted text embeddings. However, it is worth noting that these\nopen-vocabulary recognition models still exhibit limitations in practical\napplications. On one hand, they rely on the provision of class names during\ntesting, where the recognition performance heavily depends on this predefined\nset of semantic classes by users. On the other hand, when training with\nmultiple datasets, human intervention is required to alleviate the label\ndefinition conflict between them. In this paper, we introduce the OmniScient\nModel (OSM), a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based mask classifier, as a\nstraightforward and effective solution to the aforementioned challenges.\nSpecifically, OSM predicts class labels in a generative manner, thus removing\nthe supply of class names during both training and testing. It also enables\ncross-dataset training without any human interference, exhibiting robust\ngeneralization capabilities due to the world knowledge acquired from the LLM.\nBy combining OSM with an off-the-shelf mask proposal model, we present\npromising results on various benchmarks, and demonstrate its effectiveness in\nhandling novel concepts.

Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe\nthem with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration\nof events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency\nwithin their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before\nare mutually exclusive for any pair of events). We evaluate state-of-the-art\nLLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.\nGenerally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as\nwell as small-scale, specialised LMs. In-context learning, instruction tuning,\nand chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.\nCrucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent\nbehaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions. Contrary to expectations, we\nalso find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in\nperformance. To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may\ngather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled\ntexts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event\nordering. Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal\ntasks. Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of\ntextual narratives.

We introduce SimpleSafetyTests (SST) as a new test suite for\nrapidly and systematically identifying such critical safety risks. The test\nsuite comprises 100 test prompts across five harm areas that LLMs, for the vast\nmajority of applications, should refuse to comply with. We test 11 open-access\nand open-source LLMs and four closed-source LLMs, and find critical safety\nweaknesses. While some of the models do not give a single unsafe response, most\ngive unsafe responses to more than 20% of the prompts, with over 50% unsafe\nresponses in the extreme. Prepending a safety-emphasising system prompt\nsubstantially reduces the occurrence of unsafe responses, but does not\ncompletely stop them from happening. Trained annotators labelled every model\nresponse to SST (n = 3,000). We use these annotations to evaluate five AI\nsafety filters (which assess whether a models' response is unsafe given a\nprompt) as a way of automatically evaluating models' performance on SST. The\nfilters' performance varies considerably. There are also differences across the\nfive harm areas, and on the unsafe versus safe responses.

        "summary": "LLMs and AI chatbots have improved people's efficiency in various fields.\nHowever, the necessary knowledge for answering the question may be beyond the\nmodels' knowledge boundaries. To mitigate this issue, many researchers try to\nintroduce external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs and Internet contents,\ninto LLMs for up-to-date information. However, the external information from\nthe Internet may include counterfactual information that will confuse the model\nand lead to an incorrect response. Thus there is a pressing need for LLMs to\npossess the ability to distinguish reliable information from external\nknowledge. Therefore, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to discern the\nreliability of external knowledge, we create a benchmark from existing\nknowledge bases. Our benchmark consists of two tasks, Question Answering and\nText Generation, and for each task, we provide models with a context containing\ncounterfactual information. Evaluation results show that existing LLMs are\nsusceptible to interference from unreliable external knowledge with\ncounterfactual information, and simple intervention methods make limited\ncontributions to the alleviation of this issue.",

However,\nLLMs are not exempt from drawbacks. One of the most concerning aspects regards\nthe emerging problematic phenomena known as \"Hallucinations\". They manifest in\ntext generation systems, particularly in question-answering systems reliant on\nLLMs, potentially resulting in false or misleading information propagation.\nThis paper delves into the underlying causes of AI hallucination and elucidates\nits significance in artificial intelligence. In particular, Hallucination\nclassification is tackled over several tasks (Machine Translation, Question and\nAnswer, Dialog Systems, Summarisation Systems, Knowledge Graph with LLMs, and\nVisual Question Answer). Additionally, we explore potential strategies to\nmitigate hallucinations, aiming to enhance the overall reliability of LLMs. Our\nresearch addresses this critical issue within the HeReFaNMi (Health-Related\nFake News Mitigation) project, generously supported by NGI Search, dedicated to\ncombating Health-Related Fake News dissemination on the Internet.

Understanding social multimedia content remains a challenging\nproblem for contemporary machine learning frameworks. In this paper, we explore\nGPT-4V(ision)'s capabilities for social multimedia analysis. We select five\nrepresentative tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fake\nnews identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection,\nto evaluate GPT-4V. Our investigation begins with a preliminary quantitative\nanalysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a careful\nreview of the results and a selection of qualitative samples that illustrate\nGPT-4V's potential in understanding multimodal social media content. GPT-4V\ndemonstrates remarkable efficacy in these tasks, showcasing strengths such as\njoint understanding of image-text pairs, contextual and cultural awareness, and\nextensive commonsense knowledge. Despite the overall impressive capacity of\nGPT-4V in the social media domain, there remain notable challenges. GPT-4V\nstruggles with tasks involving multilingual social multimedia comprehension and\nhas difficulties in generalizing to the latest trends in social media.\nAdditionally, it exhibits a tendency to generate erroneous information in the\ncontext of evolving celebrity and politician knowledge, reflecting the known\nhallucination problem. The insights gleaned from our findings underscore a\npromising future for LMMs in enhancing our comprehension of social media\ncontent and its users through the analysis of multimodal information.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have highlighted a phenomenon in large language models (LLMs)\nknown as \"the reversal curse,\" in which the order of knowledge entities in the\ntraining data biases the models' comprehension. For example, if a model is\ntrained on sentences where entity A consistently appears before entity B, it\ncan respond to queries about A by providing B as the answer. However, it may\nencounter confusion when presented with questions concerning B. We contend that\nthe reversal curse is partially a result of specific model training objectives,\nparticularly evident in the prevalent use of the next-token prediction within\nmost causal language models. For the next-token prediction, models solely focus\non a token's preceding context, resulting in a restricted comprehension of the\ninput. In contrast, we illustrate that the GLM, trained using the\nautoregressive blank infilling objective where tokens to be predicted have\naccess to the entire context, exhibits better resilience against the reversal\ncurse. We propose a novel training method, BIdirectional Casual language\nmodeling Optimization (BICO), designed to mitigate the reversal curse when\nfine-tuning pretrained causal language models on new data. BICO modifies the\ncausal attention mechanism to function bidirectionally and employs a mask\ndenoising optimization. In the task designed to assess the reversal curse, our\napproach improves Llama's accuracy from the original 0% to around 70%. We hope\nthat more attention can be focused on exploring and addressing these inherent\nweaknesses of the current LLMs, in order to achieve a higher level of\nintelligence.",

But an LLM could make up reasonably\nsounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent\nwork has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT\nexplanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not\nmeasure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their\nself-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We\nclarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability,\ncharacterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we\nunderline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for\nself-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a\ncommon suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new\nself-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a\ntest) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to\nthe predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained\nCC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions\nand to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which\ntakes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer\nto the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

A new and challenging\ntask, Story-to-Motion, arises when characters are required to move to various\nlocations and perform specific motions based on a long text description. This\ntask demands a fusion of low-level control (trajectories) and high-level\ncontrol (motion semantics). Previous works in character control and\ntext-to-motion have addressed related aspects, yet a comprehensive solution\nremains elusive: character control methods do not handle text description,\nwhereas text-to-motion methods lack position constraints and often produce\nunstable motions. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel system that\ngenerates controllable, infinitely long motions and trajectories aligned with\nthe input text. (1) We leverage contemporary Large Language Models to act as a\ntext-driven motion scheduler to extract a series of (text, position, duration)\npairs from long text. (2) We develop a text-driven motion retrieval scheme that\nincorporates motion matching with motion semantic and trajectory constraints.\n(3) We design a progressive mask transformer that addresses common artifacts in\nthe transition motion such as unnatural pose and foot sliding. Beyond its\npioneering role as the first comprehensive solution for Story-to-Motion, our\nsystem undergoes evaluation across three distinct sub-tasks: trajectory\nfollowing, temporal action composition, and motion blending, where it\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods across the\nboard.

Besides evaluating and\nanalyzing the dialogue summarization performance (DIAC-Sum) of different LLMs,\nwe also derive factual questions from the generated summaries and use them as a\nmore flexible measurement of dialogue comprehension (DIAC-QA). Our evaluation\nshows that, on average, 26.8% of the summaries generated by LLMs contain\nfactual inconsistency. Even ChatGPT, the strongest model evaluated, has such\nerrors in 16% of its summaries. For answering the factual questions, which is\nmore challenging, the average error rate of all evaluated LLMs is 36.1%. Both\nresults indicate serious deficiencies. Detailed analysis shows that the\nunderstanding of subject/object of the conversation is still challenging for\nLLMs. Furthermore, to stimulate and enhance the dialogue comprehension ability\nof LLMs, we propose a fine-tuning paradigm with auto-constructed multi-task\ndata, which achieved a relative error rate reduction of 11% on DIAC-QA.",

While various\nmethods have been proposed to push the distillation to its limits, it is still\na pain distilling LMs when a large capacity gap is exhibited between the\nteacher and the student LMs. The pain is mainly resulted by the curse of\ncapacity gap, which describes that a larger teacher LM cannot always lead to a\nbetter student LM than one distilled from a smaller teacher LM due to the\naffect of capacity gap increment. That is, there is likely an optimal point\nyielding the best student LM along the scaling course of the teacher LM. Even\nworse, the curse of capacity gap can be only partly yet not fully lifted as\nindicated in previous studies.\n  However, the tale is not ever one-sided. Although a larger teacher LM has\nbetter performance than a smaller teacher LM, it is much more\nresource-demanding especially in the context of recent large LMs (LLMs).\nConsequently, instead of sticking to lifting the curse, leaving the curse as is\nshould be arguably fine. Even better, in this paper, we reveal that the optimal\ncapacity gap is almost consistent across different student scales and\narchitectures, fortunately turning the curse into the law of capacity gap. The\nlaw later guides us to distil a 3B student LM (termed MiniMA) from a 7B teacher\nLM (adapted LLaMA2-7B). MiniMA is demonstrated to yield a new\ncompute-performance pareto frontier among existing 3B LMs on commonly used\nbenchmarks, and its instruction-tuned version (termed MiniChat) outperforms a\nwide range of 3B competitors in GPT4 evaluation and could even compete with\nseveral 7B chat models.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel metric that uses\nlarge-language models (LLM) to assess the interpretability of programmatic\npolicies. For our metric, an LLM is given both a program and a description of\nits associated programming language. The LLM then formulates a natural language\nexplanation of the program. This explanation is subsequently fed into a second\nLLM, which tries to reconstruct the program from the natural-language\nexplanation. Our metric then measures the behavioral similarity between the\nreconstructed program and the original. We validate our approach with\nsynthesized and human-crafted programmatic policies for playing a real-time\nstrategy game, comparing the interpretability scores of these programmatic\npolicies to obfuscated versions of the same programs. Our LLM-based\ninterpretability score consistently ranks less interpretable programs lower and\nmore interpretable ones higher.

Deploying LLMs to real scenarios is one of\nthe key directions in the current Internet industry. In this paper, we present\na novel pipeline to apply LLMs for domain-specific question answering (QA) that\nincorporates domain knowledge graphs (KGs), addressing an important direction\nof LLM application. As a real-world application, the content generated by LLMs\nshould be user-friendly to serve the customers. Additionally, the model needs\nto utilize domain knowledge properly to generate reliable answers. These two\nissues are the two major difficulties in the LLM application as vanilla\nfine-tuning can not adequately address them. We think both requirements can be\nunified as the model preference problem that needs to align with humans to\nachieve practical application. Thus, we introduce Knowledgeable Preference\nAlignmenT (KnowPAT), which constructs two kinds of preference set called style\npreference set and knowledge preference set respectively to tackle the two\nissues. Besides, we design a new alignment objective to align the LLM\npreference with human preference, aiming to train a better LLM for\nreal-scenario domain-specific QA to generate reliable and user-friendly\nanswers. Adequate experiments and comprehensive with 15 baseline methods\ndemonstrate that our KnowPAT is an outperforming pipeline for real-scenario\ndomain-specific QA with LLMs. Our code is open-source at\nhttps://github.com/zjukg/KnowPAT.",

To create this benchmark, we propose to distill\ndomain-specific knowledge from a large language model (LLM). We rely on a\ncurated skill-occupation graph to ensure diversity and provide context for LLMs\ngeneration. Our benchmark includes over 50 thousand triples of job\ndescriptions, matched resumes and unmatched resumes. Using RJDB, we train\nmultiple smaller student models. Our experiments reveal that the student models\nachieve near/better performance than the teacher model (GPT-4), affirming the\neffectiveness of the benchmark.

Here, we evaluate whether a\nleading LLM, ChatGPT 3.5, exhibits gender and racial bias in clinical\nmanagement of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We find that specifying patients\nas female, African American, or Hispanic resulted in a decrease in guideline\nrecommended medical management, diagnosis, and symptom management of ACS. Most\nnotably, the largest disparities were seen in the recommendation of coronary\nangiography or stress testing for the diagnosis and further intervention of ACS\nand recommendation of high intensity statins. These disparities correlate with\nbiases that have been observed clinically and have been implicated in the\ndifferential gender and racial morbidity and mortality outcomes of ACS and\ncoronary artery disease. Furthermore, we find that the largest disparities are\nseen during unstable angina, where fewer explicit clinical guidelines exist.\nFinally, we find that through asking ChatGPT 3.5 to explain its reasoning prior\nto providing an answer, we are able to improve clinical accuracy and mitigate\ninstances of gender and racial biases. This is among the first studies to\ndemonstrate that the gender and racial biases that LLMs exhibit do in fact\naffect clinical management.

Recent\nadvancements have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to potentially exhibit\nreasoning capabilities, but complex logical reasoning remains a challenge.

Despite their impressive performance, any parsing errors will\ninevitably result in the failure of the execution of the external logical\nsolver and no answer to the logical questions.

Prior attempts have quantified the\nprivacy risks of language models (LMs) via MIAs, but there is still no\nconsensus on whether existing MIA algorithms can cause remarkable privacy\nleakage on practical Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing MIAs designed for\nLMs can be classified into two categories: reference-free and reference-based\nattacks. They are both based on the hypothesis that training records\nconsistently strike a higher probability of being sampled. Nevertheless, this\nhypothesis heavily relies on the overfitting of target models, which will be\nmitigated by multiple regularization methods and the generalization of LLMs.\nThe reference-based attack seems to achieve promising effectiveness in LLMs,\nwhich measures a more reliable membership signal by comparing the probability\ndiscrepancy between the target model and the reference model. However, the\nperformance of reference-based attack is highly dependent on a reference\ndataset that closely resembles the training dataset, which is usually\ninaccessible in the practical scenario. Overall, existing MIAs are unable to\neffectively unveil privacy leakage over practical fine-tuned LLMs that are\noverfitting-free and private. We propose a Membership Inference Attack based on\nSelf-calibrated Probabilistic Variation (SPV-MIA). Specifically, since\nmemorization in LLMs is inevitable during the training process and occurs\nbefore overfitting, we introduce a more reliable membership signal,\nprobabilistic variation, which is based on memorization rather than\noverfitting. Furthermore, we introduce a self-prompt approach, which constructs\nthe dataset to fine-tune the reference model by prompting the target LLM\nitself.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful and general solutions\nto many natural language tasks. However, many of the most important\napplications of language generation are interactive, where an agent has to talk\nto a person to reach a desired outcome. For example, a teacher might try to\nunderstand their student's current comprehension level to tailor their\ninstruction accordingly, and a travel agent might ask questions of their\ncustomer to understand their preferences in order to recommend activities they\nmight enjoy. LLMs trained with supervised fine-tuning or \"single-step\" RL, as\nwith standard RLHF, might struggle which tasks that require such goal-directed\nbehavior, since they are not trained to optimize for overall conversational\noutcomes after multiple turns of interaction. In this work, we explore a new\nmethod for adapting LLMs with RL for such goal-directed dialogue. Our key\ninsight is that, though LLMs might not effectively solve goal-directed dialogue\ntasks out of the box, they can provide useful data for solving such tasks by\nsimulating suboptimal but human-like behaviors. Given a textual description of\na goal-directed dialogue task, we leverage LLMs to sample diverse synthetic\nrollouts of hypothetical in-domain human-human interactions. Our algorithm then\nutilizes this dataset with offline reinforcement learning to train an\ninteractive conversational agent that can optimize goal-directed objectives\nover multiple turns. In effect, the LLM produces examples of possible\ninteractions, and RL then processes these examples to learn to perform more\noptimal interactions. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in various goal-directed dialogue tasks that\ninclude teaching and preference elicitation.",

Our study covers 24 reasoning datasets, 4 LLMs, and 19 diverse\npersonas (e.g. an Asian person) spanning 5 socio-demographic groups.

This limitation has spurred significant research efforts to enhance LLMs'\nlong-context understanding with high-quality long-sequence benchmarks. However,\nprior datasets in this regard suffer from shortcomings, such as short context\nlength compared to the context window of modern LLMs; outdated documents that\nhave data leakage problems; and an emphasis on short dependency tasks rather\nthan long dependency tasks. In this paper, we present LooGLE, a Long Context\nGeneric Language Evaluation benchmark for LLMs' long context understanding.\nLooGLE features relatively new documents post-2022, with over 24,000 tokens per\ndocument and 6,000 newly generated questions spanning diverse domains. Human\nannotators meticulously crafted more than 1,100 high-quality question-answer\npairs to meet the long dependency requirements. These pairs underwent thorough\ncross-validation, yielding the most precise assessment of LLMs' long dependency\ncapabilities. The evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs on LooGLE revealed\nkey findings: (i) commercial models outperformed open-sourced models; (ii) LLMs\nexcelled in short dependency tasks like short question-answering and cloze\ntasks but struggled with more intricate long dependency tasks; (iii) in-context\nlearning and chaining thoughts offered only marginal improvements; (iv)\nretrieval-based techniques demonstrated substantial benefits for short\nquestion-answering, while strategies for extending context window length had\nlimited impact on long context understanding. As such, LooGLE not only provides\na systematic and comprehensive evaluation schema on long-context LLMs, but also\nsheds light on future development of enhanced models towards \"true long-context\nunderstanding\".",

A strong watermarking scheme satisfies\nthe property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark\nwithout causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the\n(im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under\nwell-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to\nachieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the\nwatermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the\nattacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark\nattack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or\neven which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The\nattacker has access to a \"quality oracle\" that can evaluate whether a candidate\noutput is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access\nto a \"perturbation oracle\" which can modify an output with a nontrivial\nprobability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing\nrandom walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be\nsatisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities\nthan the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box\naccess. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over\ntime as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing\nwatermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023),\nKuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully\nremoves the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality\ndegradation.",

Using a prototype\nimplementation, we evaluate Prompt Cache across several LLMs. We show that\nPrompt Cache significantly reduce latency in time-to-first-token, especially\nfor longer prompts such as document-based question answering and\nrecommendations.

To elicit reasoning capabilities\nfrom LLMs, recent works propose using the chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism to\ngenerate both the reasoning chain and the answer, which enhances the model's\ncapabilities in conducting multi-hop reasoning. However, several challenges\nstill remain: such as struggling with inaccurate reasoning, hallucinations, and\nlack of interpretability. On the other hand, information extraction (IE)\nidentifies entities, relations, and events grounded to the text. The extracted\nstructured information can be easily interpreted by humans and machines\n(Grishman, 2019). In this work, we investigate constructing and leveraging\nextracted semantic structures (graphs) for multi-hop question answering,\nespecially the reasoning process. Empirical results and human evaluations show\nthat our framework: generates more faithful reasoning chains and substantially\nimproves the QA performance on two benchmark datasets. Moreover, the extracted\nstructures themselves naturally provide grounded explanations that are\npreferred by humans, as compared to the generated reasoning chains and\nsaliency-based explanations.",

Existing evaluations\nof adversarial attacks and defenses on LLMs generally require either expensive\nmanual review or unreliable heuristic checks. To address this issue, we propose\nRule-following Language Evaluation Scenarios (RuLES), a programmatic framework\nfor measuring rule-following ability in LLMs. RuLES consists of 14 simple text\nscenarios in which the model is instructed to obey various rules while\ninteracting with the user.

        "summary": "A standard paradigm for sentiment analysis is to rely on a singular LLM and\nmakes the decision in a single round under the framework of in-context\nlearning. This framework suffers the key disadvantage that the single-turn\noutput generated by a single LLM might not deliver the perfect decision, just\nas humans sometimes need multiple attempts to get things right. This is\nespecially true for the task of sentiment analysis where deep reasoning is\nrequired to address the complex linguistic phenomenon (e.g., clause\ncomposition, irony, etc) in the input.\n  To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-LLM negotiation\nframework for sentiment analysis. The framework consists of a reasoning-infused\ngenerator to provide decision along with rationale, a explanation-deriving\ndiscriminator to evaluate the credibility of the generator. The generator and\nthe discriminator iterate until a consensus is reached. The proposed framework\nnaturally addressed the aforementioned challenge, as we are able to take the\ncomplementary abilities of two LLMs, have them use rationale to persuade each\nother for correction.\n  Experiments on a wide range of sentiment analysis benchmarks (SST-2, Movie\nReview, Twitter, yelp, amazon, IMDB) demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed\napproach: it consistently yields better performances than the ICL baseline\nacross all benchmarks, and even superior performances to supervised baselines\non the Twitter and movie review datasets.",

The effectiveness of\npretrained large language models (LLM) has witnessed further enhancement,\nholding potential for applications in the field of medicine, particularly in\nthe context of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). However, the application of\nthese general models to specific domains often yields suboptimal results,\nprimarily due to challenges like lack of domain knowledge, unique objectives,\nand computational efficiency. Furthermore, their effectiveness in specialized\ndomains, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, requires comprehensive\nevaluation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel domain specific\nTCMDA (TCM Domain Adaptation) approach, efficient pre-training with\ndomain-specific corpus. Specifically, we first construct a large TCM-specific\ncorpus, TCM-Corpus-1B, by identifying domain keywords and retreving from\ngeneral corpus. Then, our TCMDA leverages the LoRA which freezes the pretrained\nmodel's weights and uses rank decomposition matrices to efficiently train\nspecific dense layers for pre-training and fine-tuning, efficiently aligning\nthe model with TCM-related tasks, namely TCM-GPT-7B. We further conducted\nextensive experiments on two TCM tasks, including TCM examination and TCM\ndiagnosis. TCM-GPT-7B archived the best performance across both datasets,\noutperforming other models by relative increments of 17% and 12% in accuracy,\nrespectively. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the pioneering\nvalidation of domain adaptation of a large language model with 7 billion\nparameters in TCM domain.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce the PowerPoint Task Completion (PPTC) benchmark\nto assess LLMs' ability to create and edit PPT files based on user\ninstructions. It contains 279 multi-turn sessions covering diverse topics and\nhundreds of instructions involving multi-modal operations.

In response, we propose a two-stage process for effective\ncoverage during retrieval. First, we instruct an LLM to hallucinate a minimal\nDB schema deemed adequate to answer the query. We use the hallucinated schema\nto retrieve a subset of the actual schema, by composing the results from\nmultiple dense retrievals. Remarkably, hallucination $\\unicode{x2013}$\ngenerally considered a nuisance $\\unicode{x2013}$ turns out to be actually\nuseful as a bridging mechanism. Since no existing benchmarks exist for schema\nsubsetting on large databases, we introduce three benchmarks. Two\nsemi-synthetic datasets are derived from the union of schemas in two well-known\ndatasets, SPIDER and BIRD, resulting in 4502 and 798 schema elements\nrespectively. A real-life benchmark called SocialDB is sourced from an actual\nlarge data warehouse comprising 17844 schema elements. We show that our method1\nleads to significantly higher recall than SOTA retrieval-based augmentation\nmethods.",

Indeed, there have emerged a few works on this line where\nmost of them rely on an alignment heuristic that is built to inject the\ncorresponding knowledge tuple into the associated text sample.\n  However, despite the promise, we identify a pivotal problem in this work\nubiquitously. Simply put, we find that injecting unaligned (i.e., random)\nknowledge tuple into the LLMs achieves comparable (and sometimes better)\nresults than the aligned knowledge being injected. We therefore take a thorough\ninvestigation of this frustrating finding on a variety of related prior work\nand further provide a chain of potential interpretations for the phenomenon.\nBased on all that, we offer a simple remediated technique.

To meet the requirements of different\napplications, LLMs are often customized by further fine-tuning. However, the\npowerful learning ability of LLMs not only enables them to acquire new tasks\nbut also makes them susceptible to learning undesired behaviors. For example,\neven safety-aligned LLMs can be easily fine-tuned into harmful assistants as\nthe fine-tuning data often contains implicit or explicit harmful content. Can\nwe train LLMs on harmful data without learning harmful behaviors? This paper\nproposes a controllable training framework that makes harmful behaviors\nunlearnable during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce\n``security vectors'', a few new parameters that can be separated from the LLM,\nto ensure LLM's responses are consistent with the harmful behavior. Security\nvectors are activated during fine-tuning, the consistent behavior makes LLM\nbelieve that such behavior has already been learned, there is no need to\nfurther optimize for harmful data. During inference, we can deactivate security\nvectors to restore the LLM's normal behavior. The experimental results show\nthat the security vectors generated by 100 harmful samples are enough to\nprevent LLM from learning 1000 harmful samples, while preserving the ability to\nlearn other useful information.",

In this paper, our focus is on mitigating\nthe issue of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in the context of\nquestion-answering. Instead of attempting to answer all questions, we explore a\nrefusal mechanism that instructs LLMs to refuse to answer challenging questions\nin order to avoid errors. We then propose a simple yet effective solution\ncalled Learn to Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the refusal mechanism to\nenable LLMs to recognize and refuse to answer questions that they find\ndifficult to address. To achieve this, we utilize a structured knowledge base\nto represent all the LLM's understanding of the world, enabling it to provide\ntraceable gold knowledge. This knowledge base is separate from the LLM and\ninitially empty, and it is progressively expanded with validated knowledge.\nWhen an LLM encounters questions outside its domain, the system recognizes its\nknowledge scope and determines whether it can answer the question\nindependently. Additionally, we introduce a method for automatically and\nefficiently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs. Through qualitative and\nquantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the\ncontrollability and reliability of LLMs.",

Accommodated\nwith this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to\nboost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video\ngeneration shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different\nnoises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality\nand temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal\nnoise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose\nan optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise.\nParticularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that\nclosely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to\nserve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text\nprompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision\nworks have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation\nenhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment\nbetween the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we\ndesign a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and\ndenoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments\non popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models\nwith a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.",

There are two contributing factors to the insecure code generation.\nFirst, existing datasets used to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) do not\nadequately represent genuine software engineering tasks sensitive to security.\nInstead, they are often based on competitive programming challenges or\nclassroom-type coding tasks. In real-world applications, the code produced is\nintegrated into larger codebases, introducing potential security risks.

Metrics such as pass@k gauge the probability of obtaining the\ncorrect code in the top k suggestions.

EGS (1) explores the solution space by producing a diverse set of\nadvice relevant to the scenario, (2) generates communication candidates\nconditioned on subsets of the advice, and (3) simulates the reactions from\nvarious audiences to determine both the best candidate and advice to use. We\nevaluate the framework on eight scenarios spanning the ten fundamental\nprocesses of interpersonal communication. For each scenario, we collect a\ndataset of human evaluations across candidates and baselines, and showcase that\nour framework's chosen candidate is preferred over popular generation\nmechanisms including Chain-of-Thought. We also find that audience simulations\nachieve reasonably high agreement with human raters across 5 of the 8\nscenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our framework by applying\nit to real-world scenarios described by users on web forums. Through\nevaluations and demonstrations, we show that EGS enhances the effectiveness and\noutcomes of goal-oriented communication across a variety of situations, thus\nopening up new possibilities for the application of large language models in\nrevolutionizing communication and decision-making processes.",

However, T5 suffers from the dispersed attention issue: the longer\nthe input sequence, the flatter the attention distribution.

RLHF proceeds as collecting human preference data, training a reward\nmodel on said data, and optimizing a base ML model with respect to said reward\nfor extrinsic evaluation metrics (e.g. MMLU, GSM8k). RLHF relies on many\nassumptions about how the various pieces fit together, such as a reward model\ncapturing human preferences and an RL optimizer extracting the right signal\nfrom a reward model.

These complex architectures evaluated on\ncarefully curated long datasets perform at par or worse than simple baselines.\nIn this work, we propose a relatively simple extension to vanilla BERT\narchitecture called ChunkBERT that allows finetuning of any pretrained models\nto perform inference on arbitrarily long text. The proposed method is based on\nchunking token representations and CNN layers, making it compatible with any\npre-trained BERT. We evaluate chunkBERT exclusively on a benchmark for\ncomparing long-text classification models across a variety of tasks (including\nbinary classification, multi-class classification, and multi-label\nclassification). A BERT model finetuned using the ChunkBERT method performs\nconsistently across long samples in the benchmark while utilizing only a\nfraction (6.25\\%) of the original memory footprint. These findings suggest that\nefficient finetuning and inference can be achieved through simple modifications\nto pre-trained BERT models.",

With their remarkable capabilities in generating human-like texts, LLMs\nhave created enormous texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the\nLLMs era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents now are not only\nwritten by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these\nLLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still\nunexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of\ndifferent IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated\ntexts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval\nmodels tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher. We refer to this category\nof biases in neural retrieval models towards the LLM-generated text as the\n\\textbf{source bias}. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to\nthe first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural\nre-rankers. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of text\ncompression and observe that neural models can better understand the semantic\ninformation of LLM-generated text, which is further substantiated by our\ntheoretical analysis. To mitigate the source bias, we also propose a\nplug-and-play debiased constraint for the optimization objective, and\nexperimental results show the effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the potential\nsevere concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings\ncan serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To\nfacilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new\nbenchmarks and codes will later be available at\n\\url{https://github.com/KID-22/LLM4IR-Bias}.",

Extensive experiments on financial and medical tasks\ndemonstrate that IMFL achieves superior performance compared with single\nfidelity annotations.

These models have impacted numerous domains, from healthcare\nto education, enhancing productivity, decision-making processes, and\naccessibility. As a result, they have influenced and, to some extent, reshaped\npeople's lifestyles. However, the quadratic complexity of attention in\ntransformer architectures poses a challenge when scaling up these models for\nprocessing long textual contexts. This issue makes it impractical to train very\nlarge models on lengthy texts or use them efficiently during inference. While a\nrecent study by [KMZ23] introduced a technique that replaces the softmax with a\npolynomial function and polynomial sketching to speed up attention mechanisms,\nthe theoretical understandings of this new approach are not yet well\nunderstood.\n  In this paper, we offer a theoretical analysis of the expressive capabilities\nof polynomial attention. Our study reveals a disparity in the ability of\nhigh-degree and low-degree polynomial attention. Specifically, we construct two\ncarefully designed datasets, namely $\\mathcal{D}_0$ and $\\mathcal{D}_1$, where\n$\\mathcal{D}_1$ includes a feature with a significantly larger value compared\nto $\\mathcal{D}_0$. We demonstrate that with a sufficiently high degree\n$\\beta$, a single-layer polynomial attention network can distinguish between\n$\\mathcal{D}_0$ and $\\mathcal{D}_1$. However, with a low degree $\\beta$, the\nnetwork cannot effectively separate the two datasets. This analysis underscores\nthe greater effectiveness of high-degree polynomials in amplifying large values\nand distinguishing between datasets. Our analysis offers insight into the\nrepresentational capacity of polynomial attention and provides a rationale for\nincorporating higher-degree polynomials in attention mechanisms to capture\nintricate linguistic correlations.",

Unlike\nprevious small models (e.g., BART, T5), current LLMs make fewer silly mistakes\nbut more sophisticated ones, such as imposing cause and effect, adding false\ndetails, overgeneralizing, etc. These hallucinations are challenging to detect\nthrough traditional methods, which poses great challenges for improving the\nfactual consistency of text summarization. In this paper, we propose an\nadversarially DEcoupling method to disentangle the Comprehension and\nEmbellishmeNT abilities of LLMs (DECENT). Furthermore, we adopt a probing-based\nefficient training to cover the shortage of sensitivity for true and false in\nthe training process of LLMs. In this way, LLMs are less confused about\nembellishing and understanding; thus, they can execute the instructions more\naccurately and have enhanced abilities to distinguish hallucinations.\nExperimental results show that DECENT significantly improves the reliability of\ntext summarization based on LLMs.",

However, it is still an open question of how to\ncomprehensively and systematically evaluate the long-sequence capability of\nLLMs. One of the reasons is that conventional and widely-used benchmarks mainly\nconsist of short sequences. In this paper, we propose M4LE, a Multi-ability,\nMulti-range, Multi-task, Multi-domain benchmark for Long-context Evaluation.\nM4LE is based on a diverse NLP task pool comprising 36 NLP datasets, 11 task\ntypes and 12 domains. To alleviate the scarcity of tasks with naturally long\nsequences and incorporate multiple-ability assessment, we propose an automatic\napproach (but with negligible human annotations) to convert short-sequence\ntasks into a unified long-sequence scenario where LLMs have to identify single\nor multiple relevant spans in long contexts based on explicit or semantic\nhints. Specifically, the scenario includes five different types of abilities:\n(1) explicit single-span; (2) semantic single-span; (3) explicit multiple-span;\n(4) semantic multiple-span; and (5) global context understanding. The resulting\nsamples in M4LE are evenly distributed from 1k to 8k input length. We conducted\na systematic evaluation on 11 well-established LLMs, especially those optimized\nfor long-sequence inputs. Our results reveal that: 1) Current LLMs struggle to\nunderstand long context, particularly when tasks require multiple-span\nattention. 2) Semantic retrieval task is more difficult for competent LLMs. 3)\nModels fine-tuned on longer text with position interpolation have comparable\nperformance to those using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) aware scaling methods\nwithout fine-tuning.

This study explores\nthe potential of using four popular commercially available LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT\n(GPT 3.5 Turbo), GPT 4, Claude, and Bard, to generate functional phishing\nattacks using a series of malicious prompts. We discover that these LLMs can\ngenerate both phishing websites and emails that can convincingly imitate\nwell-known brands and also deploy a range of evasive tactics that are used to\nelude detection mechanisms employed by anti-phishing systems. These attacks can\nbe generated using unmodified or \"vanilla\" versions of these LLMs without\nrequiring any prior adversarial exploits such as jailbreaking.

We\ncompare models' analysis of this semantic structure across two settings: 1)\ndirect production of AMR parses based on zero- and few-shot prompts, and 2)\nindirect partial reconstruction of AMR via metalinguistic natural language\nqueries (e.g., \"Identify the primary event of this sentence, and the predicate\ncorresponding to that event.\"). Across these settings, we find that models can\nreliably reproduce the basic format of AMR, and can often capture core event,\nargument, and modifier structure -- however, model outputs are prone to\nfrequent and major errors, and holistic analysis of parse acceptability shows\nthat even with few-shot demonstrations, models have virtually 0% success in\nproducing fully accurate parses. Eliciting natural language responses produces\nsimilar patterns of errors.

This paper presents a methodology for evaluation of LLMs using an\nLGBTI+ lexicon in Indian languages. The methodology consists of four steps:\nformulating NLP tasks relevant to the expected behaviour, creating prompts that\ntest LLMs, using the LLMs to obtain the output and, finally, manually\nevaluating the results. Our qualitative analysis shows that the three LLMs we\nexperiment on are unable to detect underlying hateful content.

Our\napproach leverages the fact that when there is no data contamination, all\norderings of an exchangeable benchmark should be equally likely. In contrast,\nthe tendency for language models to memorize example order means that a\ncontaminated language model will find certain canonical orderings to be much\nmore likely than others. Our test flags potential contamination whenever the\nlikelihood of a canonically ordered benchmark dataset is significantly higher\nthan the likelihood after shuffling the examples. We demonstrate that our\nprocedure is sensitive enough to reliably prove test set contamination in\nchallenging situations, including models as small as 1.4 billion parameters, on\nsmall test sets of only 1000 examples, and datasets that appear only a few\ntimes in the pretraining corpus.

In this study, we discuss the limitations of MHA,\nincluding the high computational complexity due to its ``query-key-value''\narchitecture and the numerical issue caused by its softmax operation.\nConsidering the above problems and the recent development tendency of the\nattention layer, we propose an effective and efficient surrogate of the\nTransformer, called Sliceformer. Our Sliceformer replaces the classic MHA\nmechanism with an extremely simple ``slicing-sorting'' operation, i.e.,\nprojecting inputs linearly to a latent space and sorting them along different\nfeature dimensions (or equivalently, called channels). For each feature\ndimension, the sorting operation implicitly generates an implicit attention map\nwith sparse, full-rank, and doubly-stochastic structures. We consider different\nimplementations of the slicing-sorting operation and analyze their impacts on\nthe Sliceformer. We test the Sliceformer in the Long-Range Arena benchmark,\nimage classification, text classification, and molecular property prediction,\ndemonstrating its advantage in computational complexity and universal\neffectiveness in discriminative tasks. Our Sliceformer achieves comparable or\nbetter performance with lower memory cost and faster speed than the Transformer\nand its variants.

A novel approach is proposed to\ngenerate parallel Visual Question-Answering (VQA) style pairs from the source\ntext, fostering more robust cross-modal interaction. Using Large Language\nModels (LLMs), we explicitly model the probing signal in MMT to convert it into\nVQA-style data to create the Multi30K-VQA dataset. An MMT-VQA multitask\nlearning framework is introduced to incorporate explicit probing signals from\nthe dataset into the MMT training process.

In this\npaper, we present a computation-efficient framework that steers a frozen\nPre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) towards more commonsensical generation (i.e.,\nproducing a plausible output that incorporates a list of concepts in a\nmeaningful way). Specifically, we first construct a reference-free evaluator\nthat assigns a sentence with a commonsensical score by grounding the sentence\nto a dynamic commonsense knowledge base from four different relational aspects.\nWe then use the scorer as the oracle for commonsense knowledge, and extend the\ncontrollable generation method called NADO to train an auxiliary head that\nguides a fixed PTLM to better satisfy the oracle. We test our framework on a\nseries of GPT-2-, Flan-T5-, and Alpaca-based language models (LMs) on two\nconstrained concept-to-sentence benchmarks.

Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) solutions are primarily\ninteger-based and struggle with bit widths below 8 bits. Compared to integer\nquantization, floating-point (FP) quantization is more flexible and can better\nhandle long-tail or bell-shaped distributions, and it has emerged as a default\nchoice in many hardware platforms. One characteristic of FP quantization is\nthat its performance largely depends on the choice of exponent bits and\nclipping range. In this regard, we construct a strong FP-PTQ baseline by\nsearching for the optimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, we observe a\nhigh inter-channel variance and low intra-channel variance pattern in\nactivation distributions, which adds activation quantization difficulty. We\nrecognize this pattern to be consistent across a spectrum of transformer models\ndesigned for diverse tasks, such as LLMs, BERT, and Vision Transformer models.\nTo tackle this, we propose per-channel activation quantization and show that\nthese additional scaling factors can be reparameterized as exponential biases\nof weights, incurring a negligible cost. Our method, for the first time, can\nquantize both weights and activations in the LLaMA-13B to only 4-bit and\nachieves an average score of 63.1 on the common sense zero-shot reasoning\ntasks, which is only 5.8 lower than the full-precision model, significantly\noutperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 12.7 points.

Here, we focus on two prevalent methods used to\nalign these models, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). SFT is simple and robust, powering a host of\nopen-source models, while RLHF is a more sophisticated method used in top-tier\nmodels like ChatGPT but also suffers from instability and susceptibility to\nreward hacking. We propose a novel approach, Supervised Iterative Learning from\nHuman Feedback (SuperHF), which seeks to leverage the strengths of both\nmethods. Our hypothesis is two-fold: that the reward model used in RLHF is\ncritical for efficient data use and model generalization and that the use of\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in RLHF may not be necessary and could\ncontribute to instability issues. SuperHF replaces PPO with a simple supervised\nloss and a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence prior. It creates its own training\ndata by repeatedly sampling a batch of model outputs and filtering them through\nthe reward model in an online learning regime. We then break down the reward\noptimization problem into three components: robustly optimizing the training\nrewards themselves, preventing reward hacking-exploitation of the reward model\nthat degrades model performance-as measured by a novel METEOR similarity\nmetric, and maintaining good performance on downstream evaluations. Our\nexperimental results show SuperHF exceeds PPO-based RLHF on the training\nobjective, easily and favorably trades off high reward with low reward hacking,\nimproves downstream calibration, and performs the same on our GPT-4 based\nqualitative evaluation scheme all the while being significantly simpler to\nimplement, highlighting SuperHF's potential as a competitive language model\nalignment technique.",

        "summary": "A crucial challenge for generative large language models (LLMs) is diversity:\nwhen a user's prompt is under-specified, models may follow implicit assumptions\nwhile generating a response, which may result in homogenization of the\nresponses, as well as certain demographic groups being under-represented or\neven erased from the generated responses. In this paper, we formalize diversity\nof representation in generative LLMs. We present evaluation datasets and\npropose metrics to measure diversity in generated responses along people and\nculture axes. We find that LLMs understand the notion of diversity, and that\nthey can reason and critique their own responses for that goal. This finding\nmotivated a new prompting technique called collective-critique and self-voting\n(CCSV) to self-improve people diversity of LLMs by tapping into its diversity\nreasoning capabilities, without relying on handcrafted examples or prompt\ntuning. Extensive empirical experiments with both human and automated\nevaluations show that our proposed approach is effective at improving people\nand culture diversity, and outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin.",

Position\nEmbedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window\nto a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their\nextrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context\nwindow. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We\ngeneralise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by\nordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby\novercoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific\nlengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond\nthe training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with\nimpressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be\nseamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such\nas LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference\nlatency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the\ncontext window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration\nin performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench\nbenchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance\nagainst state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to\n32k.

Recently,\nthe large language model (LLM) has exhibited emergent abilities and achieved\ngreat breakthroughs both in the CV and NLP communities. Thus, it is logical to\nincorporate RS with LLM better, which has become an emerging research\ndirection. Although some existing works have made their contributions to this\nissue, they mainly consider the single key situation (e.g. historical\ninteractions), especially in sequential recommendation. The situation of\nmultiple key-value data is simply neglected. This significant scenario is\nmainstream in real practical applications, where the information of users (e.g.\nage, occupation, etc) and items (e.g. title, category, etc) has more than one\nkey. Therefore, we aim to implement sequential recommendations based on\nmultiple key-value data by incorporating RS with LLM. In particular, we\ninstruct tuning a prevalent open-source LLM (Llama 7B) in order to inject\ndomain knowledge of RS into the pre-trained LLM. Since we adopt multiple\nkey-value strategies, LLM is hard to learn well among these keys. Thus the\ngeneral and innovative shuffle and mask strategies, as an innovative manner of\ndata argument, are designed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nextensive experiments are conducted on the popular and suitable dataset\nMovieLens which contains multiple keys-value.

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved promising\nzero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task\naffecting various downstream applications and domains. Given the great\npotential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate\ntheir limitations in dealing with different image and question properties. In\nthis work, we investigate whether MLLMs can perceive small details as well as\nlarge details in images. In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy\nin answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual\nsubject of the question, declining up to 46% with size. Furthermore, we show\nthat this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can\nsignificantly mitigate their sensitivity to size. Inspired by the usefulness of\nhuman cropping, we then propose five automatic visual cropping methods --\nleveraging either external localization models or the decision process of the\ngiven MLLM itself -- as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot\nperformance of MLLMs. We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA\ndatasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual\ndetails. Our findings suggest that MLLMs should be used with caution in\ndetail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising\ndirection to improve their zero-shot performance. To facilitate further\ninvestigation of MLLMs' behaviors, our code and data are publicly released.",

The key strategy of these\nmodels is to, for each processed token, activate at most a few experts -\nsubsets of an extensive feed-forward layer. But this approach is not without\nits challenges. The operation of matching experts and tokens is discrete, which\nmakes MoE models prone to issues like training instability and uneven expert\nutilization. Existing techniques designed to address these concerns, such as\nauxiliary losses or balance-aware matching, result either in lower model\nperformance or are more difficult to train. In response to these issues, we\npropose Mixture of Tokens, a fully-differentiable model that retains the\nbenefits of MoE architectures while avoiding the aforementioned difficulties.\nRather than routing tokens to experts, this approach mixes tokens from\ndifferent examples prior to feeding them to experts, enabling the model to\nlearn from all token-expert combinations. Importantly, this mixing can be\ndisabled to avoid mixing of different sequences during inference. Crucially,\nthis method is fully compatible with both masked and causal Large Language\nModel training and inference.",

Unlike most earlier machine learning models,\nthey are no longer built for one specific application but are designed to excel\nin a wide range of tasks. A major part of this success is due to their huge\ntraining datasets and the unprecedented number of model parameters, which allow\nthem to memorize large amounts of information contained in the training data.\nThis memorization goes beyond mere language, and encompasses information only\npresent in a few documents. This is often desirable since it is necessary for\nperforming tasks such as question answering, and therefore an important part of\nlearning, but also brings a whole array of issues, from privacy and security to\ncopyright and beyond. LLMs can memorize short secrets in the training data, but\ncan also memorize concepts like facts or writing styles that can be expressed\nin text in many different ways. We propose a taxonomy for memorization in LLMs\nthat covers verbatim text, facts, ideas and algorithms, writing styles,\ndistributional properties, and alignment goals. We describe the implications of\neach type of memorization - both positive and negative - for model performance,\nprivacy, security and confidentiality, copyright, and auditing, and ways to\ndetect and prevent memorization. We further highlight the challenges that arise\nfrom the predominant way of defining memorization with respect to model\nbehavior instead of model weights, due to LLM-specific phenomena such as\nreasoning capabilities or differences between decoding algorithms. Throughout\nthe paper, we describe potential risks and opportunities arising from\nmemorization in LLMs that we hope will motivate new research directions.",

The\nexperiment has demonstrated that Self-Guard is robust against jailbreak\nattacks. In the bad case analysis, we find that LLM occasionally provides\nharmless responses to harmful queries. Additionally, we evaluated the general\ncapabilities of the LLM before and after safety training, providing evidence\nthat Self-Guard does not result in the LLM's performance degradation.

We find that almost all foundational language models and some\ninstruction fine-tuned models exhibit clear ingroup-positive and\noutgroup-negative biases when prompted to complete sentences (e.g., \"We\nare...\"). A comparison of LLM-generated sentences with human-written sentences\non the internet reveals that these models exhibit similar level, if not\ngreater, levels of bias than human text. To investigate where these biases stem\nfrom, we experimentally varied the amount of ingroup-positive or\noutgroup-negative sentences the model was exposed to during fine-tuning in the\ncontext of the United States Democrat-Republican divide. Doing so resulted in\nthe models exhibiting a marked increase in ingroup solidarity and an even\ngreater increase in outgroup hostility. Furthermore, removing either\ningroup-positive or outgroup-negative sentences (or both) from the fine-tuning\ndata leads to a significant reduction in both ingroup solidarity and outgroup\nhostility, suggesting that biases can be reduced by removing biased training\ndata. Our findings suggest that modern language models exhibit fundamental\nsocial identity biases and that such biases can be mitigated by curating\ntraining data.

We observe that\nthe LLMs provide effective priors in exploiting $\\textit{linguistic shortcuts}$\nfor temporal and causal reasoning in Video Question Answering (VideoQA).\nHowever, such priors often cause suboptimal results on VideoQA by leading the\nmodel to over-rely on questions, $\\textit{i.e.}$, $\\textit{linguistic bias}$,\nwhile ignoring visual content. This is also known as `ungrounded guesses' or\n`hallucinations'. To address this problem while leveraging LLMs' prior on\nVideoQA, we propose a novel framework, Flipped-VQA, encouraging the model to\npredict all the combinations of $\\langle$V, Q, A$\\rangle$ triplet by flipping\nthe source pair and the target label to understand their complex relationships,\n$\\textit{i.e.}$, predict A, Q, and V given a VQ, VA, and QA pairs,\nrespectively. In this paper, we develop LLaMA-VQA by applying Flipped-VQA to\nLLaMA, and it outperforms both LLMs-based and non-LLMs-based models on five\nchallenging VideoQA benchmarks. Furthermore, our Flipped-VQA is a general\nframework that is applicable to various LLMs (OPT and GPT-J) and consistently\nimproves their performances. We empirically demonstrate that Flipped-VQA not\nonly enhances the exploitation of linguistic shortcuts but also mitigates the\nlinguistic bias, which causes incorrect answers over-relying on the question.\nCode is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/Flipped-VQA.",

In particular, SteloCoder achieves C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, or\nPHP-to-Python code translation without specifying the input programming\nlanguage.

The basic idea is that whenever we can tell if the given\ntext is either written by a human or an AI, we can utilize this information to\naddress the above-mentioned concerns. To that end, a plethora of detection\nframeworks have been proposed, highlighting the possibilities of AI-generated\ntext detection. But in parallel to the development of detection frameworks,\nresearchers have also concentrated on designing strategies to elude detection,\ni.e., focusing on the impossibilities of AI-generated text detection. This is a\ncrucial step in order to make sure the detection frameworks are robust enough\nand it is not too easy to fool a detector. Despite the huge interest and the\nflurry of research in this domain, the community currently lacks a\ncomprehensive analysis of recent developments. In this survey, we aim to\nprovide a concise categorization and overview of current work encompassing both\nthe prospects and the limitations of AI-generated text detection. To enrich the\ncollective knowledge, we engage in an exhaustive discussion on critical and\nchallenging open questions related to ongoing research on AI-generated text\ndetection.",

Since the well-known backdoor\ncriterion depends on the graph, any errors in the graph can propagate\ndownstream to effect inference. In this work, we initially show that complete\ngraph information is not necessary for causal effect inference; the topological\norder over graph variables (causal order) alone suffices. Further, given a node\npair, causal order is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to graph\nedges since determining the existence of an edge can depend extensively on\nother variables.

To this end, we employ different prompting strategies\nand contextual cues to propose a robust technique of obtaining causal order\nfrom LLMs. Acknowledging LLMs' limitations, we also study possible techniques\nto integrate LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, including\nconstraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves\ncausal ordering accuracy as compared to discovery algorithms, highlighting the\npotential of LLMs to enhance causal inference across diverse fields.",

However, the training process of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters,\nwhich limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real\nscenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to\nupdate, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training\nefficiency.

We conduct extensive experiments on a\nreal-world dataset of Ecommerce pre-sales dialogues. We analyze the impact of\ntwo collaborative approaches with two CRSs and two LLMs on four tasks of\nEcommerce pre-sales dialogue.

        "summary": "Recent literature has suggested the potential of using large language models\n(LLMs) to make classifications for tabular tasks. However, LLMs have been shown\nto exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities\npresent in society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data\nin many high-stake applications, it is important to explore the following\nquestions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making\nclassifications for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM\nclassifications for tabular data influenced by social biases and stereotypes;\nand what are the consequential implications for fairness?\n  Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that\nLLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly\nimpact their fairness in tabular classification tasks. Furthermore, our\ninvestigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context\nlearning and finetuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between\ndifferent subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning\nmodels, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation\nemphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and\ninherited from their pretraining corpus, not only from the downstream task\ndatasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples\ncan significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent\nbias within LLMs.",

However, they often need more nuance in assessing the\npotential harm. Unfortunately, the content of this nature falls beyond the\nreach of generative models due to its potentially harmful nature. Ethical\nrestrictions prohibit large language models (LLMs) from analyzing and\nclassifying harmful erotics, let alone generating them to create synthetic\ndatasets for other neural models. In such instances where data is scarce and\nchallenging, a thorough analysis of the structure of such texts rather than a\nlarge model may offer a viable solution. Especially given that harmful erotic\nnarratives, despite appearing similar to harmless ones, usually reveal their\nharmful nature first through contextual information hidden in the non-sexual\nparts of the narrative.\n  This paper introduces a hybrid neural and rule-based context-aware system\nthat leverages coreference resolution to identify harmful contextual cues in\nerotic content. Collaborating with professional moderators, we compiled a\ndataset and developed a classifier capable of distinguishing harmful from\nnon-harmful erotic content. Our hybrid model, tested on Polish text,\ndemonstrates a promising accuracy of 84% and a recall of 80%. Models based on\nRoBERTa and Longformer without explicit usage of coreference chains achieved\nsignificantly weaker results, underscoring the importance of coreference\nresolution in detecting such nuanced content as harmful erotics.

Results: The model demonstrated\nimpressive performance in test sets, achieving an average F1 score of 0.81 for\nsix major pathological findings in the MIMIC internal test set and 0.62 for\nseven major pathological findings in the external test set.

To facilitate the research in medical LLMs, we re-build the\nChinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (CBLUE) benchmark into a\nlarge scale prompt-tuning benchmark, PromptCBLUE. Our benchmark is a suitable\ntest-bed and an online platform for evaluating Chinese LLMs' multi-task\ncapabilities on a wide range bio-medical tasks including medical entity\nrecognition, medical text classification, medical natural language inference,\nmedical dialogue understanding and medical content/dialogue generation. To\nestablish evaluation on these tasks, we have experimented and report the\nresults with the current 9 Chinese LLMs fine-tuned with differtent fine-tuning\ntechniques.",

The complexity of these tasks makes acquiring expert\ndemonstration data both costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncontain valuable task-related knowledge that can aid in learning these reward\nfunctions. However, the direct application of LLMs for proposing reward\nfunctions has its limitations such as numerical instability and inability to\nincorporate the environment feedback. We aim to extract task knowledge from\nLLMs using environment feedback to create efficient reward functions for\nphysical skills. Our approach consists of two components. We first use the LLM\nto propose features and parameterization of the reward function. Next, we\nupdate the parameters of this proposed reward function through an iterative\nself-alignment process. In particular, this process minimizes the ranking\ninconsistency between the LLM and our learned reward functions based on the new\nobservations. We validated our method by testing it on three simulated physical\nskill learning tasks, demonstrating effective support for our design choices.",

In order to tailor an LLM to a\nspecific domain such as a web-based healthcare system, fine-tuning with domain\nknowledge is necessary. However, two issues arise during fine-tuning LLMs for\nmedical applications. The first is the problem of task variety, where there are\nnumerous distinct tasks in real-world medical scenarios. This diversity often\nresults in suboptimal fine-tuning due to data imbalance and seesawing problems.\nAdditionally, the high cost of fine-tuning can be prohibitive, impeding the\napplication of LLMs. The large number of parameters in LLMs results in enormous\ntime and computational consumption during fine-tuning, which is difficult to\njustify. To address these two issues simultaneously, we propose a novel\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-task medical applications\ncalled MOELoRA. The framework aims to capitalize on the benefits of both MOE\nfor multi-task learning and LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To unify\nMOE and LoRA, we devise multiple experts as the trainable parameters, where\neach expert consists of a pair of low-rank matrices to maintain a small number\nof trainable parameters. Additionally, we propose a task-motivated gate\nfunction for all MOELoRA layers that can regulate the contributions of each\nexpert and generate distinct parameters for various tasks. To validate the\neffectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, we conducted\ncomprehensive experiments on a public multi-task Chinese medical dataset. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that MOELoRA outperforms existing\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

We study eleven Code\nLLMs and show that they fail to preserve self-consistency, which is indeed a\ndistinct aspect from conventional accuracy.

Current methods for predicting crystal properties focus on\nmodeling crystal structures using graph neural networks (GNNs). Although GNNs\nare powerful, accurately modeling the complex interactions between atoms and\nmolecules within a crystal remains a challenge. Surprisingly, predicting\ncrystal properties from crystal text descriptions is understudied, despite the\nrich information and expressiveness that text data offer. One of the main\nreasons is the lack of publicly available data for this task.

We then propose\nLLM-Prop, a method that leverages the general-purpose learning capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) to predict the physical and electronic properties\nof crystals from their text descriptions. LLM-Prop outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art GNN-based crystal property predictor by about 4% in predicting\nband gap, 3% in classifying whether the band gap is direct or indirect, and 66%\nin predicting unit cell volume.

We show that Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on this task,\noutperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as BART-Detox. We develop 4\ndifferent prompts based on task description, hate definition, few-shot\ndemonstrations and chain-of-thoughts for comprehensive experiments and conduct\nexperiments on open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 chat, Vicuna as well\nas OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

To bridge this gap, we develop a novel benchmark\ncalled AmbiQT with over 3000 examples where each text is interpretable as two\nplausible SQLs due to lexical and/or structural ambiguity.\n  When faced with ambiguity, an ideal top-$k$ decoder should generate all valid\ninterpretations for possible disambiguation by the user.

Our main contribution in this paper\nis to propose a much simpler and readily reproducible pipeline which, in a\nnutshell, is based on efficient in-context learning by prompting LLaMA (1 and\n2) using question-informative captions as contextual information. Contrary to\nrecent approaches, our method is training-free, does not require access to\nexternal databases or APIs, and yet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the\nOK-VQA and A-OK-VQA datasets. Finally, we perform several ablation studies to\nunderstand important aspects of our method.

        "summary": "In open-domain question-answering (ODQA), most existing questions require\nsingle-hop reasoning on commonsense. To further extend this task, we officially\nintroduce open-domain multi-hop reasoning (ODMR) by answering multi-hop\nquestions with explicit reasoning steps in open-domain setting. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have found significant utility in facilitating ODQA\nwithout external corpus. Furthermore, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts\nthe reasoning capability of LLMs to a greater extent with manual or automated\nparadigms. However, existing automated methods lack of quality assurance, while\nmanual approaches suffer from limited scalability and poor diversity, hindering\nthe capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose Self-prompted\nChain-of-Thought (SP-CoT), an automated framework to mass-produce high quality\nCoTs of LLMs, by LLMs and for LLMs. SP-CoT introduces an automated generation\npipeline of high quality ODMR datasets, an adaptive sampler for in-context CoT\nselection and self-prompted inference via in-context learning. Extensive\nexperiments on four multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that our\nproposed SP-CoT not only significantly surpasses the previous SOTA methods on\nlarge-scale (175B) LLMs, but also nearly doubles the zero-shot performance of\nsmall-scale (13B) LLMs. Further analysis reveals the remarkable capability of\nSP-CoT to elicit direct and concise intermediate reasoning steps by recalling\n$\\sim$50\\% of intermediate answers on MuSiQue-Ans dataset.",

Our results show the enhanced\nprowess of LLMs when equipped with contextual information. GPT-4 outperforms\nGPT-3, but accuracy varies based on query language and claim veracity.

Alternatives such as finetuning on\ntranslation instructions are computationally expensive and may weaken\nin-context learning capabilities, due to overspecialization. In this paper, we\nprovide a closer look at this problem. We start by showing that adapter-based\nfinetuning with LoRA matches the performance of traditional finetuning while\nreducing the number of training parameters by a factor of 50. This method also\noutperforms few-shot prompting and eliminates the need for post-processing or\nin-context examples.

Finally, to obtain the\nbest of both worlds, we propose a simple approach that incorporates few-shot\nexamples during finetuning.

These models have the\ncapacity to produce hundreds and thousands of visual and textual outputs,\noffering abundant inspiration for creative endeavors. But are we harnessing\ntheir full potential? We argue that current interaction paradigms fall short,\nguiding users towards rapid convergence on a limited set of ideas, rather than\nempowering them to explore the vast latent design space in generative models.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a framework that facilitates the\nstructured generation of design space in which users can seamlessly explore,\nevaluate, and synthesize a multitude of responses. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility and usefulness of this framework through the design and development\nof an interactive system, Luminate, and a user study with 14 professional\nwriters.

The recent state-of-the-art methods show that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can be adopted to generate realistic tabular data. As\nLLMs pre-process tabular data as full text, they have the advantage of avoiding\nthe curse of dimensionality associated with one-hot encoding high-dimensional\ndata. However, their long training time and limited re-usability on new tasks\nprevent them from replacing exiting tabular generative models. In this paper,\nwe propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer based on the language model\nstructure. Through Tabula, we demonstrate the inherent limitation of employing\npre-trained language models designed for natural language processing (NLP) in\nthe context of tabular data synthesis. Our investigation delves into the\ndevelopment of a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically for tabular\ndata synthesis. Additionally, we propose a token sequence compression strategy\nto significantly reduce training time while preserving the quality of synthetic\ndata. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that using a language\nmodel structure without loading the well-trained model weights yields a better\nstarting model for tabular data synthesis. Moreover, the Tabula model,\npreviously trained on other tabular data, serves as an excellent foundation\nmodel for new tabular data synthesis tasks. Additionally, the token sequence\ncompression method substantially reduces the model's training time. Results\nshow that Tabula averagely reduces 46.2% training time per epoch comparing to\ncurrent LLMs-based state-of-the-art algorithm and consistently achieves even\nhigher synthetic data utility.",

Our experiments\nwith 80 crowdworkers compare language models with search engines (information\nretrieval systems) at facilitating fact-checking. We prompt LLMs to validate a\ngiven claim and provide corresponding explanations. Users reading LLM\nexplanations are significantly more efficient than those using search engines\nwhile achieving similar accuracy. However, they over-rely on the LLMs when the\nexplanation is wrong. To reduce over-reliance on LLMs, we ask LLMs to provide\ncontrastive information - explain both why the claim is true and false, and\nthen we present both sides of the explanation to users. This contrastive\nexplanation mitigates users' over-reliance on LLMs, but cannot significantly\noutperform search engines.

While the initial optimism that reasoning\nmight emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of\ncounterexamples, a wide spread belief in their iterative self-critique\ncapabilities persists. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate\nthe effectiveness of iterative prompting of LLMs in the context of Graph\nColoring, a canonical NP-complete reasoning problem that is related to\npropositional satisfiability as well as practical problems like scheduling and\nallocation. We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT4\nin solving graph coloring instances or verifying the correctness of candidate\ncolorings. In iterative modes, we experiment with the model critiquing its own\nanswers and an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions. In both\ncases, we analyze whether the content of the criticisms actually affects bottom\nline performance. The study seems to indicate that (i) LLMs are bad at solving\ngraph coloring instances (ii) they are no better at verifying a solution--and\nthus are not effective in iterative modes with LLMs critiquing LLM-generated\nsolutions (iii) the correctness and content of the criticisms--whether by LLMs\nor external solvers--seems largely irrelevant to the performance of iterative\nprompting. We show that the observed increase in effectiveness is largely due\nto the correct solution being fortuitously present in the top-k completions of\nthe prompt (and being recognized as such by an external verifier). Our results\nthus call into question claims about the self-critiquing capabilities of state\nof the art LLMs.",

Nevertheless, their application in real-time\nscenarios has been highly restricted due to the significant inference latency\nassociated with these models. This is particularly pronounced due to the\nautoregressive nature of generative LLM inference, where tokens are generated\nsequentially since each token depends on all previous output tokens. It is\ntherefore challenging to achieve any token-level parallelism, making inference\nextremely memory-bound. In this work, we propose SPEED, which improves\ninference efficiency by speculatively executing multiple future tokens in\nparallel with the current token using predicted values based on early-layer\nhidden states. For Transformer decoders that employ parameter sharing, the\nmemory operations for the tokens executing in parallel can be amortized, which\nallows us to accelerate generative LLM inference. We demonstrate the efficiency\nof our method in terms of latency reduction relative to model accuracy and\ndemonstrate how speculation allows for training deeper decoders with parameter\nsharing with minimal runtime overhead.",

However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have a\nknowledge cutoff and are costly to finetune repeatedly. Therefore, it is\ncrucial for LLMs to learn novel interpretations in-context. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyse the ability of LLMs to acquire novel interpretations\nusing in-context learning. To facilitate our study, we introduce MAGNIFICo, an\nevaluation suite implemented within a text-to-SQL semantic parsing framework\nthat incorporates diverse tokens and prompt settings to simulate real-world\ncomplexity. Experimental results on MAGNIFICo demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a\nsurprisingly robust capacity for comprehending novel interpretations from\nnatural language descriptions as well as from discussions within long\nconversations. Nevertheless, our findings also highlight the need for further\nimprovements, particularly when interpreting unfamiliar words or when composing\nmultiple novel interpretations simultaneously in the same example.\nAdditionally, our analysis uncovers the semantic predispositions in LLMs and\nreveals the impact of recency bias for information presented in long contexts.",

On the other\nhand, human judgments are costly to obtain, especially in the realm of\npersonalized evaluation. Inspired by these challenges, we explore the use of\nlarge language models (LLMs) for evaluating personalized text generation, and\nexamine their ability to understand nuanced user context. We present AuPEL, a\nnovel evaluation method that distills three major semantic aspects of the\ngenerated text: personalization, quality and relevance, and automatically\nmeasures these aspects. To validate the effectiveness of AuPEL, we design\ncarefully controlled experiments and compare the accuracy of the evaluation\njudgments made by LLMs versus that of judgements made by human annotators, and\nconduct rigorous analyses of the consistency and sensitivity of the proposed\nmetric. We find that, compared to existing evaluation metrics, AuPEL not only\ndistinguishes and ranks models based on their personalization abilities more\naccurately, but also presents commendable consistency and efficiency for this\ntask.

To empirically test this ability, we enrolled OpenAI's\nstate-of-the-art large language model, GPT-4, in a three-month forecasting\ntournament hosted on the Metaculus platform. The tournament, running from July\nto October 2023, attracted 843 participants and covered diverse topics\nincluding Big Tech, U.S. politics, viral outbreaks, and the Ukraine conflict.\nFocusing on binary forecasts, we show that GPT-4's probabilistic forecasts are\nsignificantly less accurate than the median human-crowd forecasts.

A\npotential explanation for this underperformance is that in real-world\nforecasting tournaments, the true answers are genuinely unknown at the time of\nprediction; unlike in other benchmark tasks like professional exams or time\nseries forecasting, where strong performance may at least partly be due to the\nanswers being memorized from the training data.

In this work, we focus on LLM\nsensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices:\nprompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot\nsettings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when\nevaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model\nsize, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our\nanalysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would\nbenefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats,\ninstead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single\nformat. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between\nmodels, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing\nmodels with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate\nsystematic analysis we propose FormatSpread, an algorithm that rapidly\nevaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and\nreports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights.\nFurthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of\nthis sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic\nperturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

Automatic data generation through large models\nis a cost-effective method, but for open-domain multimodal dialogue tasks,\nthere are still three drawbacks: 1) There is currently no open-source large\nmodel that can accept multimodal input; 2) The content generated by the model\nlacks interpretability; 3) The generated data is usually difficult to quality\ncontrol and require extensive resource to collect.

Existing MNNs are generally $\\textit{explicit}$: their modular\narchitectures are pre-defined, with individual modules expected to implement\ndistinct functions. Recent works reveal that there exists $\\textit{implicit}$\nmodularity in standard pre-trained transformers, namely $\\textit{Emergent\nModularity}$. They indicate that such modular structures spontaneously exhibit\nduring the early pre-training phase. Despite the benefits of modularity, most\nLanguage Models (LMs) are still treated as monolithic models in the pre-train\nand fine-tune paradigm, with their emergent modularity locked and\nunderutilized. In this work, focusing on unlocking the emergent modularity in\nLMs, we showcase that standard LMs could be fine-tuned as their\nMixture-of-Expert (MoEs) counterparts without introducing any extra parameters.\nSuch MoEs are derived from emergent modularity and are referred to as Emergent\nMoEs (EMoE).

Moreover, evaluation of\nthe accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can be\ndescribed correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge to\nevaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present an\nautomatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols,\nand we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with corresponding\npseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientific\nprotocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into\npseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode\nfrom a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We\nevaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We\nexternally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by\ngenerating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a\ngenerated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is\nextensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning\nabilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic\nevaluation.",

Recent advancements have extended\ntheir capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens.\nHowever, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of\ntheir input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments,\nresulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is\nlocated within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in\nsummarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source\ndocument(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the\nsummary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper,\nwe conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position\nbias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 5 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5\nevaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on\nthe which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position\nbias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization.",

Despite their\npromising capabilities, LLMs encounter challenges when directly applied to\nstance detection. First, stance detection demands multi-aspect knowledge, from\ndeciphering event-related terminologies to understanding the expression styles\nin social media platforms. Second, stance detection requires advanced reasoning\nto infer authors' implicit viewpoints, as stance are often subtly embedded\nrather than overtly stated in the text. To address these challenges, we design\na three-stage framework COLA (short for Collaborative rOle-infused LLM-based\nAgents) in which LLMs are designated distinct roles, creating a collaborative\nsystem where each role contributes uniquely. Initially, in the multidimensional\ntext analysis stage, we configure the LLMs to act as a linguistic expert, a\ndomain specialist, and a social media veteran to get a multifaceted analysis of\ntexts, thus overcoming the first challenge. Next, in the reasoning-enhanced\ndebating stage, for each potential stance, we designate a specific LLM-based\nagent to advocate for it, guiding the LLM to detect logical connections between\ntext features and stance, tackling the second challenge. Finally, in the stance\nconclusion stage, a final decision maker agent consolidates prior insights to\ndetermine the stance. Our approach avoids extra annotated data and model\ntraining and is highly usable. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each design\nrole in handling stance detection. Further experiments have demonstrated the\nexplainability and the versatility of our approach.

First,\nas the size of LLMs continues to grow, the memory demands of gradient-based\ntraining methods via backpropagation become prohibitively high. Second, given\nthe tendency of LLMs to memorize training data, it is important to protect\npotentially sensitive information in the fine-tuning data from being\nregurgitated. Zeroth-order methods, which rely solely on forward passes,\nsubstantially reduce memory consumption during training. However, directly\ncombining them with standard differentially private gradient descent suffers\nfrom growing model size. To bridge this gap, we introduce DPZero, a novel\nprivate zeroth-order algorithm with nearly dimension-independent rates. The\nmemory efficiency of DPZero is demonstrated in privately fine-tuning RoBERTa on\nsix downstream tasks.",

Recent works\npropose to utilize external programs to define search logic, such that LLMs can\nperform passive tree search to solve more challenging reasoning tasks. Though\nimpressive results have been achieved, there are several fundamental\nlimitations of these approaches. First, passive tree searches are not efficient\nas they usually require multiple rounds of LLM API calls to solve one single\nproblem. Moreover, passive search methods are not flexible since they need\ntask-specific program designs. Then a natural question arises: can we maintain\nthe tree-search capability of LLMs without the aid of external programs, and\ncan still generate responses that clearly demonstrate the process of a\ntree-structure search? To this end, we propose a new concept called autonomous\ntree-search ability of LLM, which can automatically generate a response\ncontaining search trajectories for the correct answer. Concretely, we perform\nsearch trajectories using capable LLM API via a fixed system prompt, allowing\nthem to perform autonomous tree-search (ATS) right out of the box. Experiments\non 4 puzzle games demonstrate our method can achieve huge improvements. The\nATS-BFS method outperforms the Chain of Thought approach by achieving an\naverage accuracy improvement of 33%. Compared to Tree of Thoughts, it requires\n65.6% or 47.7% less GPT-api cost to attain a comparable level of accuracy.\nMoreover, we have collected data using the ATS prompt method and fine-tuned\nLLaMA. This approach yield a greater improvement compared to the ones\nfine-tuned on CoT data. Specifically, it outperforms CoT-tuned LLaMAs by an\naverage of 40.6% and 38.5% for LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate SnD's\neffectiveness in optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff across various LLM\narchitectures and diverse downstream tasks. The results reveal a significant\nperformance improvement under the same privacy budget compared to the baseline,\noffering clients a privacy-preserving solution for local privacy protection.",

Directly pre-training LLMs for domains like medicine is\nresource-heavy and sometimes unfeasible.

A notable contribution of our study\nis the introduction of a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing\nmedical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues,\nsegmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our\npipeline, Qilin-Med, exhibits significant performance boosts. In the CPT and\nSFT phases, it achieves 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam, surpassing\nBaichuan-7B's 33.5%. In the DPO phase, on the Huatuo-26M test set, it scores\n16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE1, outperforming the SFT's 12.69 and 24.21.\nThis highlights the strength of our training approach in refining LLMs for\nmedical applications.",

However, their potential to generate\nmisinformation, often called the hallucination problem, poses a significant\nrisk to their deployment. A common approach to address this issue is to\nretrieve relevant knowledge and fine-tune the LLM with the knowledge in its\ninput. Unfortunately, this method incurs high training costs and may cause\ncatastrophic forgetting for multi-tasking models. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a knowledge-constrained decoding method called KCTS\n(Knowledge-Constrained Tree Search), which guides a frozen LM to generate text\naligned with the reference knowledge at each decoding step using a knowledge\nclassifier score and MCTS (Monte-Carlo Tree Search). To adapt the\nsequence-level knowledge classifier to token-level guidance, we also propose a\nnovel token-level hallucination detection method called RIPA (Reward Inflection\nPoint Approximation). Our empirical results on knowledge-grounded dialogue and\nabstractive summarization demonstrate the strength of KCTS as a plug-and-play,\nmodel-agnostic decoding method that can effectively reduce hallucinations in\nnatural language generation.",

However,\nsolving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite\nchallenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate\nsolutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical\nsub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers\ninstinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex\ntasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we\npropose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized\ncode generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some\nrepresentative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely,\nCodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through\nchain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by\niterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules\nand selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable\nimplementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with\nthese selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate\nnew modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to\nreuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can\nsignificantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated\nsolutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35% on APPS and 76% on\nCodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as\nopen-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation\nstudies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes,\nprogram qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's\nsuccess.",

This is a serious problem for the\ncredibility of the text. Easymark is a simple yet effective solution to this\nproblem. Easymark can inject a watermark without changing the meaning of the\ntext at all while a validator can detect if a text was generated from a system\nthat adopted Easymark or not with high credibility. Easymark is extremely easy\nto implement so that it only requires a few lines of code. Easymark does not\nrequire access to LLMs, so it can be implemented on the user-side when the LLM\nproviders do not offer watermarked LLMs. In spite of its simplicity, it\nachieves higher detection accuracy and BLEU scores than the state-of-the-art\ntext watermarking methods. We also prove the impossibility theorem of perfect\nwatermarking, which is valuable in its own right. This theorem shows that no\nmatter how sophisticated a watermark is, a malicious user could remove it from\nthe text, which motivate us to use a simple watermark such as Easymark. We\ncarry out experiments with LLM-generated texts and confirm that Easymark can be\ndetected reliably without any degradation of BLEU and perplexity, and\noutperform state-of-the-art watermarks in terms of both quality and\nreliability.",

As one of the most\nwell-established pre-LLMs approaches in reducing model complexity, network\npruning appears to lag behind in the era of LLMs, due mostly to its costly\nfine-tuning (or re-training) necessity under the massive volumes of model\nparameter and training data. To close this industry-academia gap, we introduce\nDynamic Sparse No Training (DSnoT), a training-free fine-tuning approach that\nslightly updates sparse LLMs without the expensive backpropagation and any\nweight updates. Inspired by the Dynamic Sparse Training, DSnoT minimizes the\nreconstruction error between the dense and sparse LLMs, in the fashion of\nperforming iterative weight pruning-and-growing on top of sparse LLMs. To\naccomplish this purpose, DSnoT particularly takes into account the anticipated\nreduction in reconstruction error for pruning and growing, as well as the\nvariance w.r.t. different input data for growing each weight. This practice can\nbe executed efficiently in linear time since its obviates the need of\nbackpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2,\nVicuna, and OPT across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDSnoT in enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs, especially at high sparsity\nlevels. For instance, DSnoT is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Wanda by\n26.79 perplexity at 70% sparsity with LLaMA-7B. Our paper offers fresh insights\ninto how to fine-tune sparse LLMs in an efficient training-free manner and open\nnew venues to scale the great potential of sparsity to LLMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/zyxxmu/DSnoT.",

LLM can be applied to various domains, but it contradicts the\nprinciples of information transmission when applied to the Islamic domain. In\nIslam we strictly regulates the sources of information and who can give\ninterpretations or tafseer for that sources [2]. The approach used by LLM to\ngenerate answers based on its own interpretation is similar to the concept of\ntafseer, LLM is neither an Islamic expert nor a human which is not permitted in\nIslam. Indonesia is the country with the largest Islamic believer population in\nthe world [3]. With the high influence of LLM, we need to make evaluation of\nLLM in religious domain. Currently, there is only few religious QA dataset\navailable and none of them using Sirah Nabawiyah especially in Indonesian\nLanguage. In this paper, we propose the Question Answering Sirah Nabawiyah\n(QASiNa) dataset, a novel dataset compiled from Sirah Nabawiyah literatures in\nIndonesian language. We demonstrate our dataset by using mBERT [4], XLM-R [5],\nand IndoBERT [6] which fine-tuned with Indonesian translation of SQuAD v2.0\n[7]. XLM-R model returned the best performance on QASiNa with EM of 61.20,\nF1-Score of 75.94, and Substring Match of 70.00. We compare XLM-R performance\nwith Chat GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 [1]. Both Chat GPT version returned lower EM and\nF1-Score with higher Substring Match, the gap of EM and Substring Match get\nwider in GPT-4. The experiment indicate that Chat GPT tends to give excessive\ninterpretations as evidenced by its higher Substring Match scores compared to\nEM and F1-Score, even after providing instruction and context.

These challenges\ncan be mitigated by harnessing the in-context learning capability of large\nlanguage models such as GPT-3.5. This unique feature allows the language model\nto acquire new skills through prompts, eliminating the need for data collection\nand fine-tuning.

However, the untrustworthy third-party LLMs\nmay covertly introduce vulnerabilities for downstream tasks. In this paper, we\nexplore the vulnerability of LLMs through the lens of backdoor attacks.\nDifferent from existing backdoor attacks against LLMs, ours scatters multiple\ntrigger keys in different prompt components. Such a Composite Backdoor Attack\n(CBA) is shown to be stealthier than implanting the same multiple trigger keys\nin only a single component. CBA ensures that the backdoor is activated only\nwhen all trigger keys appear. Our experiments demonstrate that CBA is effective\nin both natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal tasks. For instance,\nwith $3\\%$ poisoning samples against the LLaMA-7B model on the Emotion dataset,\nour attack achieves a $100\\%$ Attack Success Rate (ASR) with a False Triggered\nRate (FTR) below $2.06\\%$ and negligible model accuracy degradation. Our work\nhighlights the necessity of increased security research on the trustworthiness\nof foundation LLMs.",

Within just\ntwo years of development, it was unprecedentedly of high-quality, diversity,\nand creativity that the state-of-the-art models could generate. However, a\nprevalent limitation persists in the effective communication with these popular\nT2I models, such as Stable Diffusion, using natural language descriptions. This\ntypically makes an engaging image hard to obtain without expertise in prompt\nengineering with complex word compositions, magic tags, and annotations.\nInspired by the recently released DALLE3 - a T2I model directly built-in\nChatGPT that talks human language, we revisit the existing T2I systems\nendeavoring to align human intent and introduce a new task - interactive text\nto image (iT2I), where people can interact with LLM for interleaved\nhigh-quality image generation/edit/refinement and question answering with\nstronger images and text correspondences using natural language. In addressing\nthe iT2I problem, we present a simple approach that augments LLMs for iT2I with\nprompting techniques and off-the-shelf T2I models. We evaluate our approach for\niT2I in a variety of common-used scenarios under different LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT,\nLLAMA, Baichuan, and InternLM. We demonstrate that our approach could be a\nconvenient and low-cost way to introduce the iT2I ability for any existing LLMs\nand any text-to-image models without any training while bringing little\ndegradation on LLMs' inherent capabilities in, e.g., question answering and\ncode generation.

Although unlearning is particularly relevant for LLMs in light of\nthe copyright issues they raise, achieving precise unlearning is\ncomputationally infeasible for very large models. To this end, recent work has\nproposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data\nwithout retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the\nmodel parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in\npractice due to computational constraints or when the LLM is accessed via API.\nIn this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs we call\n''In-Context Unlearning'', providing inputs in context and without having to\nupdate model parameters. To unlearn a particular training instance, we provide\nthe instance alongside a flipped label and additional correctly labelled\ninstances which are prepended as inputs to the LLM at inference time. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that these contexts effectively remove\nspecific information from the training set while maintaining performance levels\nthat are competitive with (or in some cases exceed) state-of-the-art unlearning\nmethods that require access to the LLM parameters.",

Yet using long contexts poses a challenge for\nresponsive LLM systems, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is\nprocessed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by\nreusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV\ncache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause extra network\ndelays.\n  CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen\nuses a custom tensor encoder, which embraces KV cache's distributional\nproperties, to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations\nwith negligible encoding/decoding overhead. This reduces the bandwidth demand\nto fetch the KV cache. Second, to maintain low context-loading delay and high\ngeneration quality, CacheGen adapts the streaming strategies to cope with\nchanges in available bandwidth. When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may\nraise the compression level for a part of the context or choose to recompute\nits KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on four popular LLMs of various sizes\nand four datasets (662 contexts in total). Compared to the recent systems that\nreuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.7-4.3x and the\ntotal delay in fetching and processing contexts by 2.7-3.2x while having\nnegligible impact on the LLM response quality in accuracy or perplexity.",

        "summary": "Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have demonstrated\nexceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely\nactivated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for\nscaling models while maintaining a constant number of computational operations.\nExisting MoE model adopts a fixed gating network where each token is computed\nby the same number of experts. However, this approach contradicts our intuition\nthat the tokens in each sequence vary in terms of their linguistic complexity\nand, consequently, require different computational costs. Little is discussed\nin prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model\nperformance. This paper introduces adaptive gating in MoE, a flexible training\nstrategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts\nbased on expert probability distribution. The proposed framework preserves\nsparsity while improving training efficiency. Additionally, curriculum learning\nis leveraged to further reduce training time. Extensive experiments on diverse\nNLP tasks show that adaptive gating reduces at most 22.5% training time while\nmaintaining inference quality. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of\nthe routing decisions and present our insights when adaptive gating is used.",

        "summary": "Speculative decoding is a pivotal technique to accelerate the inference of\nlarge language models (LLMs) by employing a smaller draft model to predict the\ntarget model's outputs. However, its efficacy can be limited due to the low\npredictive accuracy of the draft model, particularly when faced with diverse\ntext inputs and a significant capability gap between the draft and target\nmodels. We introduce online speculative decoding (OSD) to address this\nchallenge. The main idea is to continually update (multiple) draft model(s) on\nobserved user query data using the abundant excess computational power in an\nLLM serving cluster. Given that LLM inference is memory-bounded, the surplus\ncomputational power in a typical LLM serving cluster can be repurposed for\nonline retraining of draft models, thereby making the training cost-neutral.\nSince the query distribution of an LLM service is relatively simple, retraining\non query distribution enables the draft model to more accurately predict the\ntarget model's outputs, particularly on data originating from query\ndistributions. As the draft model evolves online, it aligns with the query\ndistribution in real time, mitigating distribution shifts. We develop a\nprototype of online speculative decoding based on online knowledge distillation\nand evaluate it using both synthetic and real query data on several popular\nLLMs. The results show a substantial increase in the token acceptance rate by\n0.1 to 0.65, which translates into 1.22x to 3.06x latency reduction.",

Furthermore, ToolDec enables LLM to effectively\nselect tools using only the information contained in their names, with no need\nfor fine-tuning or in-context documentation. We evaluated multiple prior\nmethods and their ToolDec-enhanced versions on a variety of tasks involving\ntools like math functions, knowledge graph relations, and complex real-world\nRESTful APIs. Our experiments show that ToolDec reduces syntactic errors to\nzero, consequently achieving significantly better performance and as much as a\n2x speedup.

These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text\ninputs, often referred to as adversarial prompts. In this work, we propose the\ngeneration exploitation attack, an extremely simple approach that disrupts\nmodel alignment by only manipulating variations of decoding methods. By\nexploiting different generation strategies, including varying decoding\nhyper-parameters and sampling methods, we increase the misalignment rate from\n0% to more than 95% across 11 language models including LLaMA2, Vicuna, Falcon,\nand MPT families, outperforming state-of-the-art attacks with $30\\times$ lower\ncomputational cost. Finally, we propose an effective alignment method that\nexplores diverse generation strategies, which can reasonably reduce the\nmisalignment rate under our attack.

Additionally, assigning a given bug to a particular part of a\nsoftware project can help to expedite the fixing process. However, despite the\nimportance of these activities, they are quite challenging, where days can be\nspent on the manual triaging process. Past studies have attempted to leverage\nthe limited textual data of bug reports to train text classification models\nthat automate this process -- to varying degrees of success.

It next optimizes the LLM's\nsystem message via prefix-tuning on the synthetic task, and finally transfers\nthe system message to realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realistic\nabstractive summarization tasks, SynTra reduces hallucination for two\n13B-parameter LLMs using only a synthetic retrieval task for supervision.

In this study, we reveal the presence of\nmultilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky\nscenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves\nusers querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the\nsafety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users\ncombining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately\nattack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional\nscenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages\ndecreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the\nlikelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages,\nwith both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts\ncan exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with\nastonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92\\% for ChatGPT and 40.71\\% for\nGPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a\nnovel \\textsc{Self-Defense} framework that automatically generates multilingual\ntraining data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT\nfine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content\ngeneration.

However, current alignment methods often rely solely on\nsingular forms of human feedback, such as preferences, annotated labels, or\nnatural language critiques, overlooking the potential advantages of combining\nthese feedback types. This limitation leads to suboptimal performance, even\nwhen ample training data is available. In this paper, we introduce Constructive\nand Diverse Feedback (CDF) as a novel method to enhance LLM alignment, inspired\nby constructivist learning theory. Our approach involves collecting three\ndistinct types of feedback tailored to problems of varying difficulty levels\nwithin the training dataset. Specifically, we exploit critique feedback for\neasy problems, refinement feedback for medium problems, and preference feedback\nfor hard problems. By training our model with this diversified feedback, we\nachieve enhanced alignment performance while using less training data. To\nassess the effectiveness of CDF, we evaluate it against previous methods in\nthree downstream tasks: question answering, dialog generation, and text\nsummarization. Experimental results demonstrate that CDF achieves superior\nperformance even with a smaller training dataset.",

However, a significant limitation of\nsuch an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making\nits application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining\nconsistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences.\nThis paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON, to align base language\nmodels with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined\nprinciples, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is an\ninstructable reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can\ngenerate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles.

Besides the discussion about Healthcare\nconcerns, we supports the computer science community by compiling a collection\nof open source resources, such as accessible datasets, the latest\nmethodologies, code implementations, and evaluation benchmarks in the Github.\nSummarily, we contend that a significant paradigm shift is underway,\ntransitioning from PLMs to LLMs. This shift encompasses a move from\ndiscriminative AI approaches to generative AI approaches, as well as a shift\nfrom model-centered methodologies to datacentered methodologies.",

However, the current evaluations of these LLMs in LegalAI are\ndefined by the experts of computer science, lacking consistency with the logic\nof legal practice, making it difficult to judge their practical capabilities.\nTo address this challenge, we are the first to build the Chinese legal LLMs\nbenchmark LAiW, based on the logic of legal practice. To align with the\nthinking process of legal experts and legal practice (syllogism), we divide the\nlegal capabilities of LLMs from easy to difficult into three levels: basic\ninformation retrieval, legal foundation inference, and complex legal\napplication. Each level contains multiple tasks to ensure a comprehensive\nevaluation. Through automated evaluation of current general and legal domain\nLLMs on our benchmark, we indicate that these LLMs may not align with the logic\nof legal practice. LLMs seem to be able to directly acquire complex legal\napplication capabilities but perform poorly in some basic tasks, which may pose\nobstacles to their practical application and acceptance by legal experts. To\nfurther confirm the complex legal application capabilities of current LLMs in\nlegal application scenarios, we also incorporate human evaluation with legal\nexperts. The results indicate that while LLMs may demonstrate strong\nperformance, they still require reinforcement of legal logic.",

In response to this challenge,\nefforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network\npruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can\nbe pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning\nstrategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all\nlayers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this\nobservation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field\nof vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields\nstronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we\nconduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the\nemergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we\nintroduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of\nnon-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise\nsparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio\nobserved within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between\nlayerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation,\nconducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks,\ndemonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods.

For the\nevaluation protocol, apart from different prompting methods, we further\nintroduce variants to the test text and few-shot example text.

One-shot pruning\nmethods, although cost-effective and data-free, have become dominant in LLM\npruning, but lead to performance decline under the structured pruning setting.\nIn this work, we introduce a new paradigm for structurally pruning LLMs, called\nCompresso.

Then, we further augment the pruning algorithm by introducing a\ncollaborative prompt that fosters collaboration between the LLM and the pruning\nalgorithm, significantly boosting the overall performance.

The benchmark cover tasks such as\nmath problem-solving, code completion, and question answering. We evaluate\nmultiple LLMs on the collected dataset and our analysis reveals several\nnoteworthy insights: (1) Critique is generally challenging for most LLMs, and\nthis capability often emerges only when models are sufficiently large. (2) In\nparticular, self-critique is especially difficult. Even top-performing LLMs\nstruggle to achieve satisfactory performance.

Yet, the standard CoT is less effective in problems demanding\nmultiple reasoning steps. This limitation arises from the complex reasoning\nprocess in multi-step problems: later stages often depend on the results of\nseveral steps earlier, not just the results of the immediately preceding step.\nSuch complexities suggest the reasoning process is naturally represented as a\ngraph. The almost linear and straightforward structure of CoT prompting,\nhowever, struggles to capture this complex reasoning graph. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Residual Connection Prompting (RESPROMPT), a new\nprompting strategy that advances multi-step reasoning in LLMs. Our key idea is\nto reconstruct the reasoning graph within prompts. We achieve this by\nintegrating necessary connections-links present in the reasoning graph but\nmissing in the linear CoT flow-into the prompts. Termed \"residual connections\",\nthese links are pivotal in morphing the linear CoT structure into a graph\nrepresentation, effectively capturing the complex reasoning graphs inherent in\nmulti-step problems. We evaluate RESPROMPT on six benchmarks across three\ndiverse domains: math, sequential, and commonsense reasoning. For the\nopen-sourced LLaMA family of models, RESPROMPT yields a significant average\nreasoning accuracy improvement of 12.5% on LLaMA-65B and 6.8% on LLaMA2-70B.\nBreakdown analysis further highlights RESPROMPT particularly excels in complex\nmulti-step reasoning: for questions demanding at least five reasoning steps,\nRESPROMPT outperforms the best CoT based benchmarks by a remarkable average\nimprovement of 21.1% on LLaMA-65B and 14.3% on LLaMA2-70B.

Currently, LLMs are unable to\nextract or comprehend information from images and may generate inaccurate text\ndue to a lack of domain knowledge, limiting their use in forestry data\nanalysis. To address this issue, we propose a modular LLM expert system,\nTree-GPT, that integrates image understanding modules, domain knowledge bases,\nand toolchains. This empowers LLMs with the ability to comprehend images,\nacquire accurate knowledge, generate code, and perform data analysis in a local\nenvironment. Specifically, the image understanding module extracts structured\ninformation from forest remote sensing images by utilizing automatic or\ninteractive generation of prompts to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in\ngenerating and selecting optimal tree segmentation results. The system then\ncalculates tree structural parameters based on these results and stores them in\na database. Upon receiving a specific natural language instruction, the LLM\ngenerates code based on a thought chain to accomplish the analysis task. The\ncode is then executed by an LLM agent in a local environment and . For\necological parameter calculations, the system retrieves the corresponding\nknowledge from the knowledge base and inputs it into the LLM to guide the\ngeneration of accurate code. We tested this system on several tasks, including\nSearch, Visualization, and Machine Learning Analysis. The prototype system\nperformed well, demonstrating the potential for dynamic usage of LLMs in\nforestry research and environmental sciences.",

This itself presents a challenge, as it\nis difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them.\nCompounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human\nevaluation, this process is vulnerable to $\\textit{overoptimization}$, wherein\npast a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human\nratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study on\noveroptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component\nRMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then\nintroduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement\nlearning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold\nof usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by\nlearning dynamic weights, naturally expressed by Lagrange multipliers. As a\nresult, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy,\nimproving evaluation performance.

This paper asks\nwhether simulating social media through a combination of Large Language Models\n(LLM) and Agent-Based Modeling can help researchers study how different news\nfeed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations. We create realistic\npersonas using data from the American National Election Study to populate\nsimulated social media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read and share\nnews articles - and like or comment upon each other's messages - within three\nplatforms that use different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users\nsee the most liked and commented posts from users whom they follow. In the\nsecond, they see posts from all users - even those outside their own network.\nThe third platform employs a novel \"bridging\" algorithm that highlights posts\nthat are liked by people with opposing political views. We find this bridging\nalgorithm promotes more constructive, non-toxic, conversation across political\ndivides than the other two models. Though further research is needed to\nevaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold considerable potential to\nimprove simulation research on social media and many other complex social\nsettings.",

This is typically due to the absence of\ntraining data that encompasses such a specific domain, preventing GPT-4 from\nacquiring in-domain knowledge. A pressing challenge is that it's not plausible\nto continue training LLMs of such scale on in-domain data.\n  This paper introduces a simple and effective domain adaptation framework for\nGPT-4 by reformulating generation as an \\textbf{adapt-retrieve-revise} process.\nThe initial step is to \\textbf{adapt} an affordable 7B LLM to the target domain\nby continuing learning on in-domain data.

It is unlikely for LLMs to encompass all fields comprehensively.\nIn certain specific domains, their knowledge may be incomplete, and LLMs cannot\nupdate the latest knowledge in real-time. To tackle these issues, we propose a\nframework~\\emph{using LLM to \\textbf{E}nhance dialogue response generation by\nasking questions to \\textbf{D}etect user's \\textbf{I}mplicit\nin\\textbf{T}entions} (\\textbf{EDIT}). Firstly, EDIT generates open questions\nrelated to the dialogue context as the potential user's intention; Then, EDIT\nanswers those questions by interacting with LLMs and searching in\ndomain-specific knowledge bases respectively, and use LLMs to choose the proper\nanswers to questions as extra knowledge; Finally, EDIT enhances response\ngeneration by explicitly integrating those extra knowledge. Besides, previous\nquestion generation works only focus on asking questions with answers in\ncontext. In order to ask open questions, we construct a Context-Open-Question\n(COQ) dataset. On two task-oriented dialogue tasks (Wizard of Wikipedia and\nHoll-E), EDIT outperformed other LLMs.",

Despite their impressive\nperformance, the models are known to pose important risks. As these models are\ndeployed in real-world applications, a systematic understanding of different\nrisks posed by these models on tasks such as natural language inference (NLI),\nis much needed. In this paper, we define and formalize two distinct types of\nrisk: decision risk and composite risk. We also propose a risk-centric\nevaluation framework, and four novel metrics, for assessing LLMs on these risks\nin both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we propose a\nrisk-adjusted calibration method called DwD for helping LLMs minimize these\nrisks in an overall NLI architecture. Detailed experiments, using four NLI\nbenchmarks, three baselines and two LLMs, including ChatGPT, show both the\npractical utility of the evaluation framework, and the efficacy of DwD in\nreducing decision and composite risk. For instance, when using DwD, an\nunderlying LLM is able to address an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks\n(but which the LLM erroneously deems high-risk without risk adjustment) and\nskip a further 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered\nincorrectly.",

Task\nperformances typically show minor gains on small models until they improve\ndramatically once models exceed a size threshold, exemplifying the ``emergent\nabilities''. In this study, we discover that small models, although they\nexhibit minor performance, demonstrate critical and consistent task performance\nimprovements that are not captured by conventional evaluation strategies due to\ninsufficient measurement resolution.

        "summary": "Gestures perform a variety of communicative functions that powerfully\ninfluence human face-to-face interaction. How this communicative function is\nachieved varies greatly between individuals and depends on the role of the\nspeaker and the context of the interaction. Approaches to automatic gesture\ngeneration vary not only in the degree to which they rely on data-driven\ntechniques but also the degree to which they can produce context and speaker\nspecific gestures. However, these approaches face two major challenges: The\nfirst is obtaining sufficient training data that is appropriate for the context\nand the goal of the application. The second is related to designer control to\nrealize their specific intent for the application. Here, we approach these\nchallenges by using large language models (LLMs) to show that these powerful\nmodels of large amounts of data can be adapted for gesture analysis and\ngeneration. Specifically, we used ChatGPT as a tool for suggesting\ncontext-specific gestures that can realize designer intent based on minimal\nprompts. We also find that ChatGPT can suggests novel yet appropriate gestures\nnot present in the minimal training data. The use of LLMs is a promising avenue\nfor gesture generation that reduce the need for laborious annotations and has\nthe potential to flexibly and quickly adapt to different designer intents.",

        "summary": "\"Thinking is for Doing.\" Humans can infer other people's mental states from\nobservations--an ability called Theory-of-Mind (ToM)--and subsequently act\npragmatically on those inferences. Existing question answering benchmarks such\nas ToMi ask models questions to make inferences about beliefs of characters in\na story, but do not test whether models can then use these inferences to guide\ntheir actions. We propose a new evaluation paradigm for large language models\n(LLMs): Thinking for Doing (T4D), which requires models to connect inferences\nabout others' mental states to actions in social scenarios. Experiments on T4D\ndemonstrate that LLMs such as GPT-4 and PaLM 2 seemingly excel at tracking\ncharacters' beliefs in stories, but they struggle to translate this capability\ninto strategic action. Our analysis reveals the core challenge for LLMs lies in\nidentifying the implicit inferences about mental states without being\nexplicitly asked about as in ToMi, that lead to choosing the correct action in\nT4D. To bridge this gap, we introduce a zero-shot prompting framework, Foresee\nand Reflect (FaR), which provides a reasoning structure that encourages LLMs to\nanticipate future challenges and reason about potential actions. FaR boosts\nGPT-4's performance from 50% to 71% on T4D, outperforming other prompting\nmethods such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Ask. Moreover, FaR generalizes to\ndiverse out-of-distribution story structures and scenarios that also require\nToM inferences to choose an action, consistently outperforming other methods\nincluding few-shot in-context learning.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity due to their\nimpressive few-shot performance across various downstream tasks. However,\nfine-tuning all parameters and storing a unique model for each downstream task\nor domain becomes impractical because of the massive size of checkpoints (e.g.,\n350GB in GPT-3). Current literature, such as LoRA, showcases the potential of\nlow-rank modifications to the original weights of an LLM, enabling efficient\nadaptation and storage for task-specific models. These methods can reduce the\nnumber of parameters needed to fine-tune an LLM by several orders of magnitude.\nYet, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) the parameter reduction is\nlower-bounded by the rank one decomposition, and 2) the extent of reduction is\nheavily influenced by both the model architecture and the chosen rank. For\ninstance, in larger models, even a rank one decomposition might exceed the\nnumber of parameters truly needed for adaptation. In this paper, we introduce\nNOLA, which overcomes the rank one lower bound present in LoRA. It achieves\nthis by re-parameterizing the low-rank matrices in LoRA using linear\ncombinations of randomly generated matrices (basis) and optimizing the linear\nmixture coefficients only. This approach allows us to decouple the number of\ntrainable parameters from both the choice of rank and the network architecture.\nWe present adaptation results using GPT-2 and ViT in natural language and\ncomputer vision tasks. NOLA performs as well as, or better than models with\nequivalent parameter counts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can halve the\nparameters in larger models compared to LoRA with rank one, without sacrificing\nperformance.",

These resources help users\nunderstand S&P technologies and tools and suggest actionable strategies. Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as trusted information sources.\nHowever, their accuracy and correctness have been called into question. Prior\nresearch has outlined the shortcomings of LLMs in answering multiple-choice\nquestions and user ability to inadvertently circumvent model restrictions\n(e.g., to produce toxic content). Yet, the ability of LLMs to provide reliable\nS&P advice is not well-explored. In this paper, we measure their ability to\nrefute popular S&P misconceptions that the general public holds. We first study\nrecent academic literature to curate a dataset of over a hundred S&P-related\nmisconceptions across six different topics. We then query two popular LLMs\n(Bard and ChatGPT) and develop a labeling guide to evaluate their responses to\nthese misconceptions. To comprehensively evaluate their responses, we further\napply three strategies: query each misconception multiple times, generate and\nquery their paraphrases, and solicit source URLs of the responses. Both models\ndemonstrate, on average, a 21.3% non-negligible error rate, incorrectly\nsupporting popular S&P misconceptions. The error rate increases to 32.6% when\nwe repeatedly query LLMs with the same or paraphrased misconceptions. We also\nexpose that models may partially support a misconception or remain\nnoncommittal, refusing a firm stance on misconceptions. Our exploration of\ninformation sources for responses revealed that LLMs are susceptible to\nproviding invalid URLs (21.2% for Bard and 67.7% for ChatGPT) or point to\nunrelated sources (44.2% returned by Bard and 18.3% by ChatGPT).",

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics\n(RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show\nthat LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward\nmodels for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a\ntime. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model\naimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By\ncomparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we\nprovide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation\nquality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated\nhigh-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to\n21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code.

We examine the backward reasoning capabilities of LLMs on Math Word\nProblems (MWPs): given a mathematical question and its answer, with some\ndetails omitted from the question, can LLMs effectively retrieve the missing\ninformation?\n  In this paper, we formally define the backward reasoning task on math word\nproblems and modify three datasets to evaluate this task: GSM8k, SVAMP and\nMultiArith. Our findings show a significant drop in the accuracy of models on\nbackward reasoning compared to forward reasoning across four SOTA LLMs (GPT4,\nGPT3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMa-2). Utilizing the specific format of this task, we\npropose three novel techniques that improve performance: Rephrase reformulates\nthe given problem into a forward reasoning problem, PAL-Tools combines the idea\nof Program-Aided LLMs to produce a set of equations that can be solved by an\nexternal solver, and Check your Work exploits the availability of natural\nverifier of high accuracy in the forward direction, interleaving solving and\nverification steps. Finally, realizing that each of our base methods correctly\nsolves a different set of problems, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for\ncreating an ensemble over these base methods aided by a verifier to further\nboost the accuracy by a significant margin. Extensive experimentation\ndemonstrates that our techniques successively improve the performance of LLMs\non the backward reasoning task, with the final ensemble-based method resulting\nin a substantial performance gain compared to the raw LLMs with standard\nprompting techniques such as chain-of-thought.",

However, there is typically no guarantee that a programs\nimplementation and natural language documentation are aligned. In the case of a\nconflict, leveraging information in code-adjacent natural language has the\npotential to enhance fault localization, debugging, and code trustworthiness.\nIn practice, however, this information is often underutilized due to the\ninherent ambiguity of natural language which makes natural language intent\nchallenging to check programmatically. The \"emergent abilities\" of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate the translation of\nnatural language intent to programmatically checkable assertions. However, it\nis unclear if LLMs can correctly translate informal natural language\nspecifications into formal specifications that match programmer intent.\nAdditionally, it is unclear if such translation could be useful in practice. In\nthis paper, we describe LLM4nl2post, the problem leveraging LLMs for\ntransforming informal natural language to formal method postconditions,\nexpressed as program assertions. We introduce and validate metrics to measure\nand compare different LLM4nl2post approaches, using the correctness and\ndiscriminative power of generated postconditions. We then perform qualitative\nand quantitative methods to assess the quality of LLM4nl2post postconditions,\nfinding that they are generally correct and able to discriminate incorrect\ncode. Finally, we find that LLM4nl2post via LLMs has the potential to be\nhelpful in practice; specifications generated from natural language were able\nto catch 70 real-world historical bugs from Defects4J.",

Unlike natural language\nprocess (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle\nmultiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized,\nnecessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While\npre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their\ndevelopment in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity.\nRecent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust\npattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens.\nHowever, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time\nseries data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work,\nwe present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general\ntime series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin\nby reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it\ninto the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability\nto reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which\nenriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input\npatches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected\nto obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that\nTime-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art,\nspecialized forecasting models.

ReCon combines formulation and\nrefinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial\nthoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them.\nAdditionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective\ntransitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order\nallows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order\ninvolves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After\nintegrating ReCon with different LLMs, extensive experiment results from the\nAvalon game indicate its efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around\ndeceptive information without extra fine-tuning and data. Finally, we offer a\npossible explanation for the efficacy of ReCon and explore the current\nlimitations of LLMs in terms of safety, reasoning, speaking style, and format,\npotentially furnishing insights for subsequent research.",

Such geometric knowledge reasoning would require the\nability to handle structured knowledge, reason with uncertainty, verify facts,\nand backtrack when an error occurs. We propose Knowledge Crosswords, a\nmulti-blank QA dataset where each problem consists of a natural language\nquestion representing the geometric constraints of an incomplete entity\nnetwork, where LLMs are tasked with working out the missing entities while\nmeeting all factual constraints. Knowledge Crosswords contains 2,101 individual\nproblems, covering various knowledge domains and further divided into three\ndifficulty levels.

Although recent advancements in\nLLMs have demonstrated their potential in temporal reasoning, the predominant\nfocus has been on tasks such as temporal expression and temporal relation\nextraction.

A significant\ngap remains when considering complex reasoning tasks such as event forecasting,\nwhich requires multi-step temporal reasoning on events and prediction on the\nfuture timestamp.

This direction remains under-explored,\nresulting in substantial impediments to the progress of factuality evaluators.\nTo mitigate this issue, we introduce a benchmark for Factuality Evaluation of\nlarge Language Models, referred to as felm. In this benchmark, we collect\nresponses generated from LLMs and annotate factuality labels in a fine-grained\nmanner. Contrary to previous studies that primarily concentrate on the\nfactuality of world knowledge (e.g.~information from Wikipedia), felm focuses\non factuality across diverse domains, spanning from world knowledge to math and\nreasoning. Our annotation is based on text segments, which can help pinpoint\nspecific factual errors. The factuality annotations are further supplemented by\npredefined error types and reference links that either support or contradict\nthe statement. In our experiments, we investigate the performance of several\nLLM-based factuality evaluators on felm, including both vanilla LLMs and those\naugmented with retrieval mechanisms and chain-of-thought processes. Our\nfindings reveal that while retrieval aids factuality evaluation, current LLMs\nare far from satisfactory to faithfully detect factual errors.",

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising\nresults, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems.\nOne common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem\nlibrary during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know,\ncreating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but\ncrucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper\nresults. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill\nlibrary containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs\nused in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover\nenables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to\ncreate new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved\n(by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and\nreusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling\nincreasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library\nfurther bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it\neasier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass\nrate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%).\nDuring the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000\nskills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library.

To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from the\ncurrent evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from\n3B up to 80B parameter scale, on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention,\ncompositionality, explainability and instruction following.

Our empirical results demonstrate the\nexcellent performance of CF generation models as model-agnostic explainers.\nMoreover, our matching approach, which requires far less test-time resources,\nalso provides effective explanations, surpassing many baselines.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching\nprevious tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly,\npopular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence\nlength. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a\nnatural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses\nthe cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink,\nthat keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of\nwindow attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of\nattention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as\na \"sink\" even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above\nanalysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs\ntrained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite\nsequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable\nLlama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language\nmodeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.

Despite\npromising results, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive evaluation of\nthese models language-to-code generation capabilities. Existing studies often\nfocus on specific tasks, model architectures, or learning paradigms, leading to\na fragmented understanding of the overall landscape. In this work, we present\nL2CEval, a systematic evaluation of the language-to-code generation\ncapabilities of LLMs on 7 tasks across the domain spectrum of semantic parsing,\nmath reasoning and Python programming, analyzing the factors that potentially\naffect their performance, such as model size, pretraining data, instruction\ntuning, and different prompting methods. In addition to assessing model\nperformance, we measure confidence calibration for the models and conduct human\nevaluations of the output programs. This enables us to identify and analyze the\ntypical failure modes across various tasks and models. L2CEval offers a\ncomprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in\nlanguage-to-code generation. We also release the evaluation framework and all\nmodel outputs, hoping to lay the groundwork for further future research in this\ndomain.",

However, current models still struggle with intricate\nspatiotemporal prompts and often generate restricted or incorrect motion (e.g.,\neven lacking the ability to be prompted for objects moving from left to right).\nTo address these limitations, we introduce LLM-grounded Video Diffusion (LVD).\nInstead of directly generating videos from the text inputs, LVD first leverages\na large language model (LLM) to generate dynamic scene layouts based on the\ntext inputs and subsequently uses the generated layouts to guide a diffusion\nmodel for video generation. We show that LLMs are able to understand complex\nspatiotemporal dynamics from text alone and generate layouts that align closely\nwith both the prompts and the object motion patterns typically observed in the\nreal world. We then propose to guide video diffusion models with these layouts\nby adjusting the attention maps. Our approach is training-free and can be\nintegrated into any video diffusion model that admits classifier guidance. Our\nresults demonstrate that LVD significantly outperforms its base video diffusion\nmodel and several strong baseline methods in faithfully generating videos with\nthe desired attributes and motion patterns.",

In\nparticular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a\nminimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an\ninternal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework\nwith provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we\ncall \"reason for future, act for now\" (\\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design\na prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a\nfuture trajectory over a long horizon (\"reason for future\"). At each step, the\nLLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (\"act for now\"),\nstores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning\nroutine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.\n  The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in\nBayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt\nLLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory\nbuffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps\nthat maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning\nsubroutines are performed in an \"in-context\" manner to emulate the actor-critic\nupdate for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of\nlong-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\\sqrt{T}$ regret. In\nparticular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the\nprior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction\nachieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it\noutperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a\nfew benchmarks.",

However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point\nwhere it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as\nmobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution\nas it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format.\nIn terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based\non codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they\neither define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive\nmapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the\nmapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal\nsearch. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we\ninitially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered\nstructure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or\nmap weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping\noverhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint\nlearning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with\nrecent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing\nestimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel\ngradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and\ntheir mappings.

However, backtesting such\nstrategies poses a challenge because LLMs are trained on many years of data,\nand backtesting produces biased results if the training and backtesting periods\noverlap. This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may\nhave specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and\na distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named\ninterferes with the measurement of a text's sentiment. We investigate these\nsources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial\nnews headlines. We compare trading performance based on the original headlines\nwith de-biased strategies in which we remove the relevant company's identifiers\nfrom the text. In-sample (within the LLM training window), we find,\nsurprisingly, that the anonymized headlines outperform, indicating that the\ndistraction effect has a greater impact than look-ahead bias. This tendency is\nparticularly strong for larger companies--companies about which we expect an\nLLM to have greater general knowledge. Out-of-sample, look-ahead bias is not a\nconcern but distraction remains possible. Our proposed anonymization procedure\nis therefore potentially useful in out-of-sample implementation, as well as for\nde-biased backtesting.",

We then evaluate the quality of\nranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators\n(CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM\nevaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank\nits own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality\nevaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40%\nof comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that\nquestion their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the\ncorrelation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average\nRank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine\npreferences are misaligned with humans.

Apart from natural language responses, they have also been\nfound to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and\nlogical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably\nimproved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect\nor contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a\nphenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it\ndifficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in\nsafety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and\nquestion-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by\nLLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo\ntheory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated\nsolutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are\nincorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog\ncapability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs\nand deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct\nresponse. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our\nsynthesis task for evaluating our approach.

Our\nmethod allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language;\neven the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from\nnatural language. Thus, the proposed technique can enable non-expert users to\ndescribe their problems in natural language, and the combination of LLMs and\nSMT solvers can produce provably correct solutions.",

LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label\nclassification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction\nand generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,\nincluding 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific\nLLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal\ndomain, surpassing the others by a significant margin.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has\nemerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges\ndue to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it\nremains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This\npaper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse\ndivergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including\nJensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the\ncomplex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be\nsimplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the\nneed for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and\nenables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.\nOur approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient\nand supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,\nadopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and\ngeneration diversity.

Specifically, we\ncategorize existing deep model fusion methods as four-fold: (1) \"Mode\nconnectivity\", which connects the solutions in weight space via a path of\nnon-increasing loss, in order to obtain better initialization for model fusion;\n(2) \"Alignment\" matches units between neural networks to create better\nconditions for fusion; (3) \"Weight average\", a classical model fusion method,\naverages the weights of multiple models to obtain more accurate results closer\nto the optimal solution; (4) \"Ensemble learning\" combines the outputs of\ndiverse models, which is a foundational technique for improving the accuracy\nand robustness of the final model. In addition, we analyze the challenges faced\nby deep model fusion and propose possible research directions for model fusion\nin the future. Our review is helpful in deeply understanding the correlation\nbetween different model fusion methods and practical application methods, which\ncan enlighten the research in the field of deep model fusion.",

Weight-only quantization can be a promising\napproach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude\nactivation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first\npropose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates\nquantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional\nper-output-channel (per-OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that\nactivation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so\nsimilarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers within\na group. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization\ndifficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC\nquantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we propose Adaptive Dimensions\n(AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight\nsensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting\nprior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant\nimprovements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to\n+4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/johnheo/adadim-llm",

To answer this question,\nwe propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from\nhuman-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using\nhand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create\ndemonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC\nis a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the\nchain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process\nof both examples and rationale can be saved.

However, do they answer such questions based on exposure to\nsimilar questions during training (i.e., cheating), or by genuinely learning to\nextract knowledge from sources like Wikipedia?\n  In this paper, we investigate this issue using a controlled biography\ndataset. We find a strong correlation between the model's ability to extract\nknowledge and various diversity measures of the training data.\n$\\textbf{Essentially}$, for knowledge to be reliably extracted, it must be\nsufficiently augmented (e.g., through paraphrasing, sentence shuffling)\n$\\textit{during pretraining}$. Without such augmentation, knowledge may be\nmemorized but not extractable, leading to 0% accuracy, regardless of subsequent\ninstruction fine-tuning.\n  To understand why this occurs, we employ (nearly) linear probing to\ndemonstrate a strong connection between the observed correlation and how the\nmodel internally encodes knowledge -- whether it is linearly encoded in the\nhidden embeddings of entity names or distributed across other token embeddings\nin the training text.\n  This paper provides $\\textbf{several key recommendations for LLM pretraining\nin the industry}$: (1) rewrite the pretraining data -- using small, auxiliary\nmodels -- to provide knowledge augmentation, and (2) incorporate more\ninstruction-finetuning data into the pretraining stage before it becomes too\nlate.",

By\nrecognizing the pressures that this task exerts we can make predictions about\nthe strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will\nsucceed or fail. This approach - which we call the teleological approach -\nleads us to identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM\naccuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the\ntarget output, and the probability of the provided input. We predict that LLMs\nwill achieve higher accuracy when these probabilities are high than when they\nare low - even in deterministic settings where probability should not matter.\nTo test our predictions, we evaluate two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on eleven\ntasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in\nthe ways that we have hypothesized. In many cases, the experiments reveal\nsurprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple\ncipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability word sequence but only 13%\nwhen it is low-probability. These results show that AI practitioners should be\ncareful about using LLMs in low-probability situations.

        "summary": "Fine-tuning is the most effective way of adapting pre-trained large language\nmodels (LLMs) to downstream applications. With the fast growth of LLM-enabled\nAI applications and democratization of open-souced LLMs, fine-tuning has become\npossible for non-expert individuals, but intensively performed LLM fine-tuning\nworldwide could result in significantly high energy consumption and carbon\nfootprint, which may bring large environmental impact. Mitigating such\nenvironmental impact towards Green AI directly correlates to reducing the FLOPs\nof fine-tuning, but existing techniques on efficient LLM fine-tuning can only\nachieve limited reduction of such FLOPs, due to their ignorance of the\nbackpropagation cost in fine-tuning. To address this limitation, in this paper\nwe present GreenTrainer, a new LLM fine-tuning technique that adaptively\nevaluates different tensors' backpropagation costs and contributions to the\nfine-tuned model accuracy, to minimize the fine-tuning cost by selecting the\nmost appropriate set of tensors in training. Such selection in GreenTrainer is\nmade based on a given objective of FLOPs reduction, which can flexibly adapt to\nthe carbon footprint in energy supply and the need in Green AI. Experiment\nresults over multiple open-sourced LLM models and abstractive summarization\ndatasets show that, compared to fine-tuning the whole LLM model, GreenTrainer\ncan save up to 64% FLOPs in fine-tuning without any noticeable model accuracy\nloss. Compared to the existing fine-tuning techniques such as LoRa,\nGreenTrainer can achieve up to 4% improvement on model accuracy with on-par\nFLOPs reduction.",

In this paper, we explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan support the contextual emotion estimation task, by first captioning images,\nthen using an LLM for inference. First, we must understand: how well do LLMs\nperceive human emotions? And which parts of the information enable them to\ndetermine emotions? One initial challenge is to construct a caption that\ndescribes a person within a scene with information relevant for emotion\nperception. Towards this goal, we propose a set of natural language descriptors\nfor faces, bodies, interactions, and environments. We use them to manually\ngenerate captions and emotion annotations for a subset of 331 images from the\nEMOTIC dataset. These captions offer an interpretable representation for\nemotion estimation, towards understanding how elements of a scene affect\nemotion perception in LLMs and beyond. Secondly, we test the capability of a\nlarge language model to infer an emotion from the resulting image captions. We\nfind that GPT-3.5, specifically the text-davinci-003 model, provides\nsurprisingly reasonable emotion predictions consistent with human annotations,\nbut accuracy can depend on the emotion concept.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nshown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could\nhelp with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection.

Our subsequent analysis\nattributes such a gap to the LLM's inability to select and integrate rationales\nproperly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may\nnot substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor\nfor SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate\nthis proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news\ndetection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis\nfrom the LLMs' rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by\ndistillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without\nquerying LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and\nARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based,\nLLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.",

This study benchmarks the performance and\ncomputational efficiency of Prompt Tuning and baselines for multi-label text\nclassification. This is applied to the challenging task of classifying\ncompanies into an investment firm's proprietary industry taxonomy, supporting\ntheir thematic investment strategy. Text-to-text classification is frequently\nreported to outperform task-specific classification heads, but has several\nlimitations when applied to a multi-label classification problem where each\nlabel consists of multiple tokens: (a) Generated labels may not match any label\nin the label taxonomy; (b) The fine-tuning process lacks permutation invariance\nand is sensitive to the order of the provided labels; (c) The model provides\nbinary decisions rather than appropriate confidence scores. Limitation (a) is\naddressed by applying constrained decoding using Trie Search, which slightly\nimproves classification performance. All limitations (a), (b), and (c) are\naddressed by replacing the PLM's language head with a classification head,\nwhich is referred to as Prompt Tuned Embedding Classification (PTEC). This\nimproves performance significantly, while also reducing computational costs\nduring inference. In our industrial application, the training data is skewed\ntowards well-known companies. We confirm that the model's performance is\nconsistent across both well-known and less-known companies. Our overall results\nindicate the continuing need to adapt state-of-the-art methods to\ndomain-specific tasks, even in the era of PLMs with strong generalization\nabilities.

Based on this approach,\nwe propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task.\nExperiments on several KGQA benchmarks show that the proposed KG-to-Text\naugmented LLMs approach outperforms previous KG-augmented LLMs approaches\nregarding answer accuracy and usefulness of knowledge statements.",

In\naddition to the pursuit of better performance and the avoidance of violent\nfeedback on a certain prompt, to ensure the responsibility of the LLM, much\nattention is drawn to the robustness of LLMs. However, existing evaluation\nmethods mostly rely on traditional question answering datasets with predefined\nsupervised labels, which do not align with the superior generation capabilities\nof contemporary LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel rational\nevaluation approach that leverages pre-trained reward models as diagnostic\ntools to evaluate the longer conversation generated from more challenging open\nquestions by LLMs, which we refer to as the Reward Model for Reasonable\nRobustness Evaluation (TREvaL). Longer conversations manifest the comprehensive\ngrasp of language models in terms of their proficiency in understanding\nquestions, a capability not entirely encompassed by individual words or\nletters, which may exhibit oversimplification and inherent biases. Our\nextensive empirical experiments demonstrate that TREvaL provides an innovative\nmethod for evaluating the robustness of an LLM. Furthermore, our results\ndemonstrate that LLMs frequently exhibit vulnerability to word-level\nperturbations that are commonplace in daily language usage. Notably, we are\nsurprised to discover that robustness tends to decrease as fine-tuning (SFT and\nRLHF) is conducted. The code of TREval is available in\nhttps://github.com/Harry-mic/TREvaL.",

Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable\nlines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when\ngenerating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we\ndeny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To\nevaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain\nsmart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC\nsecurity. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397\nEthereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning\ntook more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned\nmodel could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation\nUnderstudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were\nvulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing\ndifferent types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that\nmore than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further\nfine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of\nvulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning\ntook only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and\nfound that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as\nvulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could\nefficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.",

To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on\nretrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain\ntext. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are\nnaturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on.\nRepresenting such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the\nuser's mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has\nto query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and\nseemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this\nfundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called\nPDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure\nor content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nPDFTriage-augmented models across several classes of questions where existing\nretrieval-augmented LLMs fail.

This paper addresses this\nchallenge by exploring the integration of Legal LLMs with Federated Learning\n(FL) methodologies.

This approach is characterized by a two-stage process: drafting and\nverification. The drafting stage generates draft tokens at a slightly lower\nquality but more quickly, which is achieved by selectively skipping certain\nintermediate layers during drafting Subsequently, the verification stage\nemploys the original LLM to validate those draft output tokens in one forward\npass. This process ensures the final output remains identical to that produced\nby the unaltered LLM, thereby maintaining output quality. The proposed method\nrequires no additional neural network training and no extra memory footprint,\nmaking it a plug-and-play and cost-effective solution for inference\nacceleration. Benchmarks with LLaMA-2 and its fine-tuned models demonstrated a\nspeedup up to 1.73$\\times$.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLM) evolve in their capabilities, various recent\nstudies have tried to quantify their behavior using psychological tools created\nto study human behavior. One such example is the measurement of \"personality\"\nof LLMs using self-assessment personality tests developed to measure human\npersonality. Yet almost none of these works verify the applicability of these\ntests on LLMs. In this paper, we analyze the reliability of LLM personality\nscores obtained from self-assessment personality tests using two simple\nexperiments. We first introduce the property of prompt sensitivity, where three\nsemantically equivalent prompts representing three intuitive ways of\nadministering self-assessment tests on LLMs are used to measure the personality\nof the same LLM. We find that all three prompts lead to very different\npersonality scores, a difference that is statistically significant for all\ntraits in a large majority of scenarios. We then introduce the property of\noption-order symmetry for personality measurement of LLMs. Since most of the\nself-assessment tests exist in the form of multiple choice question (MCQ)\nquestions, we argue that the scores should also be robust to not just the\nprompt template but also the order in which the options are presented. This\ntest unsurprisingly reveals that the self-assessment test scores are not robust\nto the order of the options. These simple tests, done on ChatGPT and three\nLlama2 models of different sizes, show that self-assessment personality tests\ncreated for humans are unreliable measures of personality in LLMs.",

However, analyzing\nuser intents in log data is not easy, especially for emerging forms of Web\nsearch such as AI-driven chat. To understand user intents from log data, we\nneed a way to label them with meaningful categories that capture their\ndiversity and dynamics. Existing methods rely on manual or machine-learned\nlabeling, which are either expensive or inflexible for large and dynamic\ndatasets. We propose a novel solution using large language models (LLMs), which\ncan generate rich and relevant concepts, descriptions, and examples for user\nintents.

We also present an\nend-to-end pipeline that uses an LLM with human-in-the-loop to produce, refine,\nand apply labels for user intent analysis in log data. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness by uncovering new insights into user intents from search and chat\nlogs from the Microsoft Bing commercial search engine.

One\neffective strategy is leveraging semantic similarity between the ICL\ndemonstrations and test inputs by using a text retriever, which however is\nsub-optimal as that does not consider the LLM's existing knowledge about that\ntask. From prior work (Lyu et al., 2023), we already know that labels paired\nwith the demonstrations bias the model predictions. This leads us to our\nhypothesis whether considering LLM's existing knowledge about the task,\nespecially with respect to the output label space can help in a better\ndemonstration selection strategy. Through extensive experimentation on three\ntext classification tasks, we find that it is beneficial to not only choose\nsemantically similar ICL demonstrations but also to choose those demonstrations\nthat help resolve the inherent label ambiguity surrounding the test example.\nInterestingly, we find that including demonstrations that the LLM previously\nmis-classified and also fall on the test example's decision boundary, brings\nthe most performance gain.",

Previous research typically gathered human preference data and\nthen aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction\ntuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without\nrequiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of\nthe latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind\nmechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human\npreferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method,\nRewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to\nevaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind\nand generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra\ndata for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation,\nor parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the\nharmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while\nmaintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the\ntruthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%.",

Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

To address this challenge,\nwe propose to perform confidence estimation for the predictions to help on-call\nengineers make decisions on whether to adopt the model prediction. Considering\nthe black-box nature of many LLM-based root cause predictors, fine-tuning or\ntemperature-scaling-based approaches are inapplicable. We therefore design an\ninnovative confidence estimation framework based on prompting\nretrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) that demand a minimal amount\nof information from the root cause predictor. This approach consists of two\nscoring phases: the LLM-based confidence estimator first evaluates its\nconfidence in making judgments in the face of the current incident that\nreflects its ``grounded-ness\" level in reference data, then rates the root\ncause prediction based on historical references. An optimization step combines\nthese two scores for a final confidence assignment. We show that our method is\nable to produce calibrated confidence estimates for predicted root causes,\nvalidate the usefulness of retrieved historical data and the prompting strategy\nas well as the generalizability across different root cause prediction models.\nOur study takes an important move towards reliably and effectively embedding\nLLMs into cloud incident management systems.",

Current techniques for public health analysis\ninvolve popular models such as BERT and large language models (LLMs). However,\nthe costs of training in-domain LLMs for public health are especially\nexpensive. Furthermore, such kinds of in-domain datasets from social media are\ngenerally imbalanced. To tackle these challenges, the data imbalance issue can\nbe overcome by data augmentation and balanced training. Moreover, the ability\nof the LLMs can be effectively utilized by prompting the model properly. In\nthis paper, a novel ALEX framework is proposed to improve the performance of\npublic health analysis on social media by adopting an LLMs explanation\nmechanism. Results show that our ALEX model got the best performance among all\nsubmissions in both Task 2 and Task 4 with a high score in Task 1 in Social\nMedia Mining for Health 2023 (SMM4H)[1].

However, these privatization efforts often ignored a critical aspect:\nDual Logic Ability, which is a core reasoning ability for LLMs. The dual logic\nability of LLMs ensures that they can maintain a consistent stance when\nconfronted with both positive and negative statements about the same fact. Our\nstudy focuses on how the dual logic ability of LLMs is affected during the\nprivatization process in the medical domain. We conduct several experiments to\nanalyze the dual logic ability of LLMs by examining the consistency of the\nstance in responses to paired questions about the same fact. In our\nexperiments, interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in the dual\nlogic ability of existing LLMs after privatization. Besides, our results\nindicate that incorporating general domain dual logic data into LLMs not only\nenhances LLMs' dual logic ability but also further improves their accuracy.\nThese findings underscore the importance of prioritizing LLMs' dual logic\nability during the privatization process. Our study establishes a benchmark for\nfuture research aimed at exploring LLMs' dual logic ability during the\nprivatization process and offers valuable guidance for privatization efforts in\nreal-world applications.",

Such data collections come with\nlimited metadata and strict access policies that could limit access to the data\ncontents and, therefore, limit the application of classic retrieval and\nanalysis solutions. As a result, there is a need for solutions that can\neffectively utilize the available metadata.

The resulting matching enables the use of an available or curated\nbusiness glossary for retrieval and analysis without or before requesting\naccess to the data contents. One solution to this problem is to use\nmanually-defined rules or similarity measures on column names and glossary\ndescriptions (or their vector embeddings) to find the closest match. However,\nsuch approaches need to be tuned through manual labeling and cannot handle many\nbusiness glossaries that contain a combination of simple as well as complex and\nlong descriptions. In this work, we leverage the power of large language models\n(LLMs) to design generic matching methods that do not require manual tuning and\ncan identify complex relations between column names and glossaries. We propose\nmethods that utilize LLMs in two ways: a) by generating additional context for\ncolumn names that can aid with matching b) by using LLMs to directly infer if\nthere is a relation between column names and glossary descriptions.

This work shows that modern\nLLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent\n\"selection bias\", namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers\n(like \"Option A\"). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three\nbenchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs'\ntoken bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to\nspecific option ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the\noption IDs. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time\ndebiasing method, called PriDe, which separates the model's prior bias for\noption IDs from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe first estimates the\nprior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and\nthen applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples. We\ndemonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high\ncomputational efficiency. We hope this work can draw broader research attention\nto the bias and robustness of modern LLMs.",

The proposed\narchitecture is the Masked Autoencoder pre-trained on ImageNet (with the\nlimitation that there is a large domain discrepancy between ImageNet and DEM)\nwith an UperNet Head for decoding segmentations. We tested this model with 450\nand 50 training images only, utilizing roughly 5% and 0.5% of the original data\nrespectively. On the building segmentation task, this model obtains an 82.1%\nIntersection over Union (IoU) with 450 Images and 69.1% IoU with only 50\nimages. On the more challenging road detection task the model obtains an 82.7%\nIoU with 450 images and 73.2% IoU with only 50 images. Any hand-labeled dataset\nmade today about the earths surface will be immediately obsolete due to the\nconstantly changing nature of the landscape. This motivates the clear necessity\nfor data-efficient learners that can be used for a wide variety of downstream\ntasks.",

Qualitative methodology\nencompasses a broad family of techniques involving manual analysis of\nopen-ended interviews or conversations conducted freely in natural language.\nHere we consider whether artificial \"silicon participants\" generated by LLMs\nmay be productively studied using qualitative methods aiming to produce\ninsights that could generalize to real human populations. The key concept in\nour analysis is algorithmic fidelity, a term introduced by Argyle et al. (2023)\ncapturing the degree to which LLM-generated outputs mirror human\nsub-populations' beliefs and attitudes. By definition, high algorithmic\nfidelity suggests latent beliefs elicited from LLMs may generalize to real\nhumans, whereas low algorithmic fidelity renders such research invalid. Here we\nused an LLM to generate interviews with silicon participants matching specific\ndemographic characteristics one-for-one with a set of human participants. Using\nframework-based qualitative analysis, we showed the key themes obtained from\nboth human and silicon participants were strikingly similar. However, when we\nanalyzed the structure and tone of the interviews we found even more striking\ndifferences. We also found evidence of the hyper-accuracy distortion described\nby Aher et al. (2023). We conclude that the LLM we tested (GPT-3.5) does not\nhave sufficient algorithmic fidelity to expect research on it to generalize to\nhuman populations. However, the rapid pace of LLM research makes it plausible\nthis could change in the future. Thus we stress the need to establish epistemic\nnorms now around how to assess validity of LLM-based qualitative research,\nespecially concerning the need to ensure representation of heterogeneous lived\nexperiences.",

To continuously uncover the\npotential of LLMs, incorporate data from new sources, and improve LLMs'\nperformance, we build a new system named Data-Juicer, with which we can\nefficiently generate diverse data recipes, explore different possibilities in\nforming data mixtures, and evaluate their effects on model performance.\nDifferent from traditional data-analytics pipelines, Data-Juicer faces some\nunique challenges. Firstly, the possible data sources for forming data recipes\nare truly heterogeneous and massive with various qualities. Secondly, it is\nextremely expensive to precisely evaluate data recipes' impact on LLMs'\nperformance. Thirdly, the end users of Data-Juicer, model developers, need\nsufficient flexibility to configure and evaluate different data recipes.\n  Data-Juicer features a fine-grained abstraction of pipelines for constructing\ndata recipes, with over 50 built-in operators for easy composition and\nextension. By incorporating visualization and auto-evaluation capabilities,\nData-Juicer enables a timely feedback loop for both LLM pre-training and\nfine-tuning. Further, Data-Juicer is optimized and integrated with ecosystems\nfor LLM training, evaluation, and distributed computing. The data recipes\nderived with Data-Juicer gain notable improvements on state-of-the-art LLMs, by\nup to 7.45% increase in averaged score across 16 LLM benchmarks and 17.5%\nhigher win rate in pair-wise GPT-4 evaluations. Our system, data recipes, and\ntutorials are released, calling for broader data-centric research on training\nand understanding LLMs.",

PTQ\nmethods commonly keep the softmax activation in higher precision as it has been\nshown to be very sensitive to quantization noise. However, this can lead to a\nsignificant runtime and power overhead during inference on resource-constraint\nedge devices. In this work, we investigate the source of the softmax\nsensitivity to quantization and show that the quantization operation leads to a\nlarge bias in the softmax output, causing accuracy degradation. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose an offline bias correction technique that improves the\nquantizability of softmax without additional compute during deployment, as it\ncan be readily absorbed into the quantization parameters. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on stable diffusion v1.5 and 125M-size OPT language\nmodel, achieving significant accuracy improvement for 8-bit quantized softmax.",

However, existing research\nlacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on\ndifferent large language models, which make it challenging to identify the\npotential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this\npaper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration on large language models. We analyze the performance of different\nlarge language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and\ncounterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and\nChinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate\ntestbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve\nthe case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the\nchallenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while\nLLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle\nsignificantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and\ndealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate\nthat there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to\nLLMs.",

As the adoption of LLMs becomes more widespread in\nsoftware coding ecosystems, a pressing issue has emerged: does the generated\ncode contain social bias and unfairness, such as those related to age, gender,\nand race? This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and ethical foundation\nof software applications that depend on the code generated by these models, yet\nis under-explored in the literature. This paper presents a novel bias testing\nframework that is specifically designed for code generation tasks. Based on\nthis framework, we conduct an extensive evaluation of the bias in code\ngenerated by five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that 20.29% to\n44.93% code functions generated by the models under study are biased when\nhandling bias sensitive tasks (i.e., tasks that involve sensitive attributes\nsuch as age and gender). This indicates that the existing LLMs can be unfair in\ncode generation, posing risks of unintended and harmful software behaviors. To\nmitigate bias for code generation models, we evaluate five bias mitigation\nprompt strategies, i.e., utilizing bias testing results to refine the code\n(zero-shot), one-, few-shot, and two Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Our\nevaluation results illustrate that these strategies are all effective in\nmitigating bias. Overall, one-shot and few-shot learning are the two most\neffective.

We\nfind that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with\nthe relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more\nchallenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more\npowerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and\npreprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in\ncomputer vision.",

        "summary": "We aim to better understand the emergence of `situational awareness' in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). A model is situationally aware if it's aware that it's\na model and can recognize whether it's currently in testing or deployment.\nToday's LLMs are tested for safety and alignment before they are deployed. An\nLLM could exploit situational awareness to achieve a high score on safety\ntests, while taking harmful actions after deployment. Situational awareness may\nemerge unexpectedly as a byproduct of model scaling. One way to better foresee\nthis emergence is to run scaling experiments on abilities necessary for\nsituational awareness. As such an ability, we propose `out-of-context\nreasoning' (in contrast to in-context learning). We study out-of-context\nreasoning experimentally. First, we finetune an LLM on a description of a test\nwhile providing no examples or demonstrations. At test time, we assess whether\nthe model can pass the test. To our surprise, we find that LLMs succeed on this\nout-of-context reasoning task. Their success is sensitive to the training setup\nand only works when we apply data augmentation. For both GPT-3 and LLaMA-1,\nperformance improves with model size. These findings offer a foundation for\nfurther empirical study, towards predicting and potentially controlling the\nemergence of situational awareness in LLMs. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/AsaCooperStickland/situational-awareness-evals.",

However, when\napplied to mathematical reasoning tasks, LLMs often struggle to generate\ncorrect reasoning steps and answers despite having high probabilities for the\nsolutions. To overcome this limitation and enhance the mathematical reasoning\ncapabilities of fine-tuned LLMs without additional fine-tuning steps, we\npropose a method that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a\nlightweight energy function to rank decision steps and enable immediate\nreaction and precise reasoning.

We then\nutilize MCTS with the energy function as a path verifier to search the output\nspace and evaluate the reasoning path. Through extensive experiments on two\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, GSM8k and AQUA-RAT, we demonstrate the\nexceptional capabilities of our method, which significantly improves the pass@1\nmetric of the fine-tuned model without requiring additional fine-tuning or\nreinforcement learning with human feedback alignment.",

A straightforward strategy improving efficiency is to\nbatch data within the token limit (e.g., 8k for gpt-3.5-turbo; 32k for GPT-4),\nwhich we call BatchPrompt. We have two initial observations for prompting with\nbatched data. First, we find that prompting with batched data in longer\ncontexts will inevitably lead to worse performance, compared to single-data\nprompting. Second, the performance of the language model is significantly\ncorrelated with the positions and order of the batched data, due to the\ncorresponding change in decoder context. To retain efficiency and overcome\nperformance loss, we propose Batch Permutation and Ensembling (BPE), and a\nnovel Self-reflection-guided EArly Stopping (SEAS) technique. Our comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that BPE can boost the performance of\nBatchPrompt with a striking margin on a range of popular NLP tasks, including\nquestion answering (Boolq), textual entailment (RTE), and duplicate questions\nidentification (QQP). These performances are even competitive with/higher than\nsingle-data prompting(SinglePrompt), while BatchPrompt requires much fewer LLM\ncalls and input tokens (For SinglePrompt v.s.

Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-aware\nprompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context.Unlike\nexisting approaches, we use LLM-based query rewriting only during the training\nphase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead of\nthe original queries during training.

The varying\nprefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using\npipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.\n  We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs\nchunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and\ndecode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk\nand populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill\nchunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up\nto an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills\nallows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill\nrequest, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback.

Being a prevalent compression\ntechnique, quantization has emerged as the mainstream practice to tackle this\nissue, which is mainly centered on two recipes W8A8 and W4A16 (i.e. weights and\nactivations in such bit widths). In this study, we propose a novel W4A8\npost-training quantization method for the available open-sourced LLMs, which\ncombines the advantages of both two recipes. Therefore, we can leverage the\nbenefit in the I/O utilization of 4-bit weight quantization and the\nacceleration due to 8-bit matrix computation. Nevertheless, the W4A8 faces\nnotorious performance degradation. As a remedy, we involve layerwise activation\nquantization strategies which feature a novel logarithmic equalization for most\nintractable layers, and we combine them with fine-grained weight quantization.\nWithout whistles and bells, we eliminate the necessity for further fine-tuning\nand obtain the state-of-the-art W4A8 quantized performance on BLOOM, LLaMA, and\nLLaMA-2 on standard benchmarks. We confirm that the W4A8 quantization is\nachievable for the deployment of large language models, fostering their\nwide-spreading real-world applications.",

As\nthe scale of datasets continues to grow, privacy risks arising from\nmemorization have attracted increasing attention. Quantifying language model\nmemorization helps evaluate potential privacy risks. However, prior works on\nquantifying memorization require access to the precise original data or incur\nsubstantial computational overhead, making it difficult for applications in\nreal-world language models. To this end, we propose a fine-grained,\nentity-level definition to quantify memorization with conditions and metrics\ncloser to real-world scenarios. In addition, we also present an approach for\nefficiently extracting sensitive entities from autoregressive language models.\nWe conduct extensive experiments based on the proposed, probing language\nmodels' ability to reconstruct sensitive entities under different settings. We\nfind that language models have strong memorization at the entity level and are\nable to reproduce the training data even with partial leakages. The results\ndemonstrate that LLMs not only memorize their training data but also understand\nassociations between entities. These findings necessitate that trainers of LLMs\nexercise greater prudence regarding model memorization, adopting memorization\nmitigation techniques to preclude privacy violations.",

To address this, we propose to recursively\ngenerate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance\nlong-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to\nmemorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using\nprevious memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily\ngenerate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We\nevaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the\nwidely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent\nresponses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could\nnicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced\nLLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a\npotential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The\ncode and scripts will be released later.",

Visual Prompting (VP),\ndrawing inspiration from the prompting techniques employed in Large Language\nModels (LLMs), has emerged as a pivotal method for transfer learning in the\nrealm of computer vision. As the importance of efficiency continues to rise,\nresearch into model compression has become indispensable in alleviating the\ncomputational burdens associated with training and deploying over-parameterized\nneural networks. A primary objective in model compression is to develop sparse\nand/or quantized models capable of matching or even surpassing the performance\nof their over-parameterized, full-precision counterparts. Although previous\nstudies have explored the effects of model compression on transfer learning,\nits impact on visual prompting-based transfer remains unclear. This study aims\nto bridge this gap, shedding light on the fact that model compression\ndetrimentally impacts the performance of visual prompting-based transfer,\nparticularly evident in scenarios with low data volume. Furthermore, our\nfindings underscore the adverse influence of sparsity on the calibration of\ndownstream visual-prompted models. However, intriguingly, we also illustrate\nthat such negative effects on calibration are not present when models are\ncompressed via quantization. This empirical investigation underscores the need\nfor a nuanced understanding beyond mere accuracy in sparse and quantized\nsettings, thereby paving the way for further exploration in Visual Prompting\ntechniques tailored for sparse and quantized models.",

We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender\nbias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias\ndataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs.\nWe test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased\nassumptions about men and women's occupations. Our contributions in this paper\nare as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that\nstereotypically aligns with a person's gender; (b) these choices align with\npeople's perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official\njob statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in\nperceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in\nsentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly\nprompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their\nchoices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind\ntheir predictions.

Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs'\nlong context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated\nmemory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating\nlong context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench,\nthe first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding,\nenabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench\ncomprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese,\nwith an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters\n(Chinese).

However,\na difficulty of linking the biomedical entities using current large language\nmodels (LLM) trained on a general corpus is that biomedical entities are\nscarcely distributed in texts and therefore have been rarely seen during\ntraining by the LLM. At the same time, those LLMs are not aware of high level\nsemantic connection between different biomedical entities, which are useful in\nidentifying similar concepts in different textual contexts. To cope with\naforementioned problems, some recent works focused on injecting knowledge graph\ninformation into LLMs. However, former methods either ignore the relational\nknowledge of the entities or lead to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, we\npropose a novel framework to pre-train the powerful generative LLM by a corpus\nsynthesized from a KG.

However, the transition of LLMs from\ndata centers to edge devices presents a set of challenges and opportunities.\nWhile this shift can enhance privacy and availability, it is hampered by the\nenormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs.\nIn light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device\ninference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant\nof sparse LLMs that exhibit nearly constant computational complexity as their\nparameter size scales. EdgeMoE achieves both memory and computational\nefficiency by strategically partitioning the model across the storage\nhierarchy. Specifically, non-expert weights are stored in the device's memory,\nwhile expert weights are kept in external storage and are fetched into memory\nonly when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight\nthat expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse\nactivation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert\nI/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise\nbitwidth adaptation: This method reduces the size of expert weights with an\nacceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the\nexperts that will be activated in advance and preloads them into the\ncompute-I/O pipeline, thus further optimizing the process. In empirical\nevaluations conducted on well-established MoE LLMs and various edge devices,\nEdgeMoE demonstrates substantial memory savings and performance improvements\nwhen compared to competitive baseline solutions.",

To address this issue, we propose LMSanitator, a novel approach for\ndetecting and removing task-agnostic backdoors on Transformer models.

LMSanitator further\nleverages prompt-tuning's property of freezing the pretrained model to perform\naccurate and fast output monitoring and input purging during the inference\nphase.

With recent advancements of large\nlanguage models (LLM), it would be useful to know how the popular LLM\ninterfaces perform in classifying or extracting information from crash\nnarratives. To explore this, our study has used the three most popular publicly\navailable LLM interfaces- ChatGPT, BARD and GPT4. This study investigated their\nusefulness and boundaries in extracting information and answering queries\nrelated to accidents from 100 crash narratives from Iowa and Kansas. During the\ninvestigation, their capabilities and limitations were assessed and their\nresponses to the queries were compared. Five questions were asked related to\nthe narratives: 1) Who is at-fault? 2) What is the manner of collision? 3) Has\nthe crash occurred in a work-zone? 4) Did the crash involve pedestrians? and 5)\nWhat are the sequence of harmful events in the crash? For questions 1 through\n4, the overall similarity among the LLMs were 70%, 35%, 96% and 89%,\nrespectively. The similarities were higher while answering direct questions\nrequiring binary responses and significantly lower for complex questions. To\ncompare the responses to question 5, network diagram and centrality measures\nwere analyzed. The network diagram from the three LLMs were not always similar\nalthough they sometimes have the same influencing events with high in-degree,\nout-degree and betweenness centrality. This study suggests using multiple\nmodels to extract viable information from narratives. Also, caution must be\npracticed while using these interfaces to obtain crucial safety related\ninformation.",

However,\nthe scarcity of high-quality instruction-tuning data for vision-language tasks\nremains a challenge. The current leading paradigm, such as LLaVA, relies on\nlanguage-only GPT-4 to generate data, which requires pre-annotated image\ncaptions and detection bounding boxes, suffering from understanding image\ndetails. A practical solution to this problem would be to utilize the available\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate instruction data for\nvision-language tasks.

As a solution for\naddressing the current issue, this paper proposes the Visual Instruction\nGeneration and Correction (VIGC) framework that enables multimodal large\nlanguage models to generate instruction-tuning data and progressively enhance\nits quality on-the-fly. Specifically, Visual Instruction Generation (VIG)\nguides the vision-language model to generate diverse instruction-tuning data.\nTo ensure generation quality, Visual Instruction Correction (VIC) adopts an\niterative update mechanism to correct any inaccuracies in data produced by VIG,\neffectively reducing the risk of hallucination.

Moreover, to enhance stability of the prompt effect evaluation, we\npropose a novel prompt bagging method involving forward and backward thinking,\nwhich is superior to majority voting and is beneficial for both feedback and\nweight calculation in boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nPREFER achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of tasks by a\nsignificant margin. We have made our code publicly available.",

However, the growing\nintertwining of big models with everyday human lives poses potential risks and\nmight cause serious social harm. Therefore, many efforts have been made to\nalign LLMs with humans to make them better follow user instructions and satisfy\nhuman preferences. Nevertheless, `what to align with' has not been fully\ndiscussed, and inappropriate alignment goals might even backfire. In this\npaper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of different alignment goals in\nexisting work and trace their evolution paths to help identify the most\nessential goal. Particularly, we investigate related works from two\nperspectives: the definition of alignment goals and alignment evaluation. Our\nanalysis encompasses three distinct levels of alignment goals and reveals a\ngoal transformation from fundamental abilities to value orientation, indicating\nthe potential of intrinsic human values as the alignment goal for enhanced\nLLMs. Based on such results, we further discuss the challenges of achieving\nsuch intrinsic value alignment and provide a collection of available resources\nfor future research on the alignment of big models.",

Attempting to alleviate inferential\nfallacies and drawing inspiration from multi-agent collaboration, we present a\nframework to increase faithfulness and causality for knowledge-based reasoning.\nSpecifically, we propose to employ multiple intelligent agents (i.e., reasoners\nand an evaluator) to work collaboratively in a reasoning-and-consensus paradigm\nfor elevated reasoning faithfulness. The reasoners focus on providing solutions\nwith human-like causality to solve open-domain problems. On the other hand, the\n\\textit{evaluator} agent scrutinizes if a solution is deducible from a\nnon-causal perspective and if it still holds when challenged by a\ncounterfactual candidate. According to the extensive and comprehensive\nevaluations on a variety of knowledge reasoning tasks (e.g., science question\nanswering and commonsense reasoning), our framework outperforms all compared\nstate-of-the-art approaches by large margins.",

However, previous works have shown these models are\nsensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order,\nposing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become\nmore powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these\nlimitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of\nmultiple-choice questions -- commonly adopted task to study reasoning and\nfact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs\ntowards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a\nconsiderable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different\nbenchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations\nin a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this\nsensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the\ntop-2/3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction\nbetween those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias.\nWe also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model's\nbias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal\nstrategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last\noptions. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among\nthe adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various\nexperiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs' predictions, leading to\nup to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.",

This ability could\npotentially be used to predict plausible solutions in sequential decision\nmaking tasks pertaining to pattern completion. For example, by observing a\npartial stack of cubes, LLMs can predict the correct sequence in which the\nremaining cubes should be stacked by extrapolating the observed patterns (e.g.,\ncube sizes, colors or other attributes) in the partial stack. In this work, we\nintroduce LaGR (Language-Guided Reinforcement learning), which uses this\npredictive ability of LLMs to propose solutions to tasks that have been\npartially completed by a primary reinforcement learning (RL) agent, in order to\nsubsequently guide the latter's training. However, as RL training is generally\nnot sample-efficient, deploying this approach would inherently imply that the\nLLM be repeatedly queried for solutions; a process that can be expensive and\ninfeasible. To address this issue, we introduce SEQ (sample efficient\nquerying), where we simultaneously train a secondary RL agent to decide when\nthe LLM should be queried for solutions. Specifically, we use the quality of\nthe solutions emanating from the LLM as the reward to train this agent. We show\nthat our proposed framework LaGR-SEQ enables more efficient primary RL\ntraining, while simultaneously minimizing the number of queries to the LLM.

Driven by the power of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), two prominent methods have emerged: (1) the hybrid integration between\nLLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where visual inputs are firstly\nconverted into language descriptions by VLMs, serving as inputs for LLMs to\ngenerate final answer(s); (2) visual feature alignment in language space, where\nvisual inputs are encoded as embeddings and projected to LLMs' language space\nvia further supervised fine-tuning. The first approach provides light training\ncosts and interpretability but is hard to be optimized in an end-to-end\nfashion. The second approach presents decent performance, but feature alignment\nusually requires large amounts of training data and lacks interpretability. To\ntackle this dilemma, we propose a novel approach, Inner Monologue Multi-Modal\nOptimization (IMMO), to solve complex vision language problems by simulating\ninner monologue processes, a cognitive process in which an individual engages\nin silent verbal communication with themselves. We enable LLMs and VLMs to\ninteract through natural language conversation and propose to use a two-stage\ntraining process to learn how to do the inner monologue (self-asking questions\nand answering questions). IMMO is evaluated on two popular tasks and the\nresults suggest by emulating the cognitive phenomenon of internal dialogue, our\napproach can enhance reasoning and explanation abilities, contributing to the\nmore effective fusion of vision and language models. More importantly, instead\nof using predefined human-crafted monologues, IMMO learns this process within\nthe deep learning models, promising wider applicability to many different AI\nproblems beyond vision language tasks.",

Our approach,\nMultiPL-T, translates training data from high-resource languages into training\ndata for low-resource languages in the following way. 1) We use a Code LLM to\nsynthesize tests for commented code from a high-resource language, filtering\nout faulty tests and code with low test coverage. 2) We use a Code LLM to\ntranslate Python code to a target low-resource language, and use tests to\nvalidate the translation. We apply this approach to generate tens of thousands\nof validated training items for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. Furthermore,\nwe use an open model (StarCoderBase) with open training data (The Stack), which\nallows us to decontaminate benchmarks, train models without violating licenses,\nand run experiments that could not otherwise be done.\n  With MultiPL-T generated data, we present fine-tuned versions of\nStarCoderBase and Code Llama for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. On\nestablished benchmarks (MultiPL-E), these models outperform other open Code\nLLMs. The MultiPL-T approach is easy to apply to new languages, and is\nsignificantly more efficient and effective than alternatives such as training\nlonger.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in\ninstruction-following, becoming increasingly crucial across various\napplications. However, this capability brings with it the risk of prompt\ninjection attacks, where attackers inject instructions into LLMs' input to\nelicit undesirable actions or content. Understanding the robustness of LLMs\nagainst such attacks is vital for their safe implementation. In this work, we\nestablish a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of instruction-following LLMs\nagainst prompt injection attacks. Our objective is to determine the extent to\nwhich LLMs can be influenced by injected instructions and their ability to\ndifferentiate between these injected and original target instructions. Through\nextensive experiments with leading instruction-following LLMs, we uncover\nsignificant vulnerabilities in their robustness to such attacks. Our results\nindicate that some models are overly tuned to follow any embedded instructions\nin the prompt, overly focusing on the latter parts of the prompt without fully\ngrasping the entire context. By contrast, models with a better grasp of the\ncontext and instruction-following capabilities will potentially be more\nsusceptible to compromise by injected instructions. This underscores the need\nto shift the focus from merely enhancing LLMs' instruction-following\ncapabilities to improving their overall comprehension of prompts and\ndiscernment of instructions that are appropriate to follow. We hope our\nin-depth analysis offers insights into the underlying causes of these\nvulnerabilities, aiding in the development of future solutions.

As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the\ncontinual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the\nforgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning\nfrom the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading\ncomprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally\nobserved in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Moreover, as the model scale\nincreases, the severity of forgetting intensifies. Comparing the decoder-only\nmodel BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less\nforgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs\ncan mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that ALPACA maintains more\nknowledge and capacity compared to LLAMA during continual fine-tuning,\nsuggesting that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting\nphenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning processes.",

Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states\nare values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They\nusually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it\nto update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL\nhidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,\nand residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden\nstates contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,\nthe performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model\nediting, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes\ncertain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights\ndo not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above\nfindings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer\nComponent (TC, namely MHSA and FFN) hidden states, while only using the\noptimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that PMET exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both\nthe COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets.

Deep train-from-scratch models have\nexhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits\nreal-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the\nrepresentation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However,\nincorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited\nadaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic\ndata, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting\nwith pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the\n\\textit{time-series alignment} stage to align LLMs with the nuances of\ntime-series data, and the \\textit{forecasting fine-tuning} stage for downstream\ntime-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel\ntwo-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within\npre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific\ninformation. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS\nis superior to existing state-of-the-art methods compared with\ntrained-from-scratch models in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves an\naverage improvement of 6.84% in MSE in few-shot scenarios.

While providing\nconvenience for various societal needs, LLMs have also lowered the cost of\ngenerating harmful content. Consequently, LLM developers have deployed\nsemantic-level defenses to recognize and reject prompts that may lead to\ninappropriate content. Unfortunately, these defenses are not foolproof, and\nsome attackers have crafted \"jailbreak\" prompts that temporarily hypnotize the\nLLM into forgetting content defense rules and answering any improper questions.\nTo date, there is no clear explanation of the principles behind these\nsemantic-level attacks and defenses in both industry and academia.\n  This paper investigates the LLM jailbreak problem and proposes an automatic\njailbreak method for the first time. We propose the concept of a semantic\nfirewall and provide three technical implementation approaches. Inspired by the\nattack that penetrates traditional firewalls through reverse tunnels, we\nintroduce a \"self-deception\" attack that can bypass the semantic firewall by\ninducing LLM to generate prompts that facilitate jailbreak. We generated a\ntotal of 2,520 attack payloads in six languages (English, Russian, French,\nSpanish, Chinese, and Arabic) across seven virtual scenarios, targeting the\nthree most common types of violations: violence, hate, and pornography. The\nexperiment was conducted on two models, namely the GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. The\nsuccess rates on the two models were 86.2% and 67%, while the failure rates\nwere 4.7% and 2.2%, respectively. This highlighted the effectiveness of the\nproposed attack method. All experimental code and raw data will be released as\nopen-source to inspire future research. We believe that manipulating AI\nbehavior through carefully crafted prompts will become an important research\ndirection in the future.",

Taking well-known\ncontracts opinions, and sourcing the actual agreements that they adjudicated,\nwe show that AI models can help factfinders ascertain ordinary meaning in\ncontext, quantify ambiguity, and fill gaps in parties' agreements. We also\nillustrate how models can calculate the probative value of individual pieces of\nextrinsic evidence.

Using LLMs permits courts to estimate what the parties\nintended cheaply and accurately, and as such generative interpretation\nunsettles the current interpretative stalemate. Their use responds to\nefficiency-minded textualists and justice-oriented contextualists, who argue\nabout whether parties will prefer cost and certainty or accuracy and fairness.\nParties--and courts--would prefer a middle path, in which adjudicators strive\nto predict what the contract really meant, admitting just enough context to\napproximate reality while avoiding unguided and biased assimilation of\nevidence. As generative interpretation offers this possibility, we argue it can\nbecome the new workhorse of contractual interpretation.",

However, these conventional ML/DL models have\ncertain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled\ndatasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and\nmaintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking\ngeneralizability. Recently, large pre-trained models, also known as FMs, have\ndemonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision-making\ntasks across various domains. These models are trained on a large amount of\ndata from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish\nversatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and minimal task-specific labeled\ndata. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been\nlittle exploration of applying FMs to agriculture AI. Thus, this study aims to\nexplore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular,\nconceptual tools and technical background are presented to help the\nunderstanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions. To this\nend, recent FMs in the general CS domain are reviewed, and the models are\ncategorized into four categories: language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and\nreinforcement learning FMs. Then, the steps of developing agriculture FMs\n(AFMs) are outlined and potential applications in smart agriculture are\ndiscussed. Moreover, challenges and risks associated with developing AFMs are\ndiscussed, including model training, validation, and deployment. In summary,\nthe advancement of AI in agriculture is explored by introducing AFMs as a\npromising paradigm that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive\nlabeled datasets and enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization\nof agricultural AI systems.",

This challenge has\nrecently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising\ntechnique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point\nrepresentations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by\nassuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in\nthe literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN\nweights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse\non LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,\noutlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly\nadopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,\nnamely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the\nscalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.\nHowever, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a\nchallenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post\ntraining optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight\nvalues in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this\nlimitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire\nquantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,\ni.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by\nalleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function\nis compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the\nmethod to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and\ndata-driven configurations.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated outstanding\nperformance in various fields, particularly in natural language understanding\nand generation tasks. In complex application scenarios, users tend to engage in\nmulti-turn conversations with ChatGPT to keep contextual information and obtain\ncomprehensive responses. However, human forgetting and model contextual\nforgetting remain prominent issues in multi-turn conversation scenarios, which\nchallenge the users' conversation comprehension and contextual continuity for\nChatGPT. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive conversation\nvisualization system called C5, which includes Global View, Topic View, and\nContext-associated Q\\&A View. The Global View uses the GitLog diagram metaphor\nto represent the conversation structure, presenting the trend of conversation\nevolution and supporting the exploration of locally salient features. The Topic\nView is designed to display all the question and answer nodes and their\nrelationships within a topic using the structure of a knowledge graph, thereby\ndisplay the relevance and evolution of conversations. The Context-associated\nQ\\&A View consists of three linked views, which allow users to explore\nindividual conversations deeply while providing specific contextual information\nwhen posing questions. The usefulness and effectiveness of C5 were evaluated\nthrough a case study and a user study.",

The emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) introduces an innovative paradigm, offering a unified solution to\naddress various authoring tasks within this scenario.

Furthermore, LLMs like GPT-3.5 necessitate remote accessibility,\nraising concerns about safeguarding voluminous customer privacy data during\ntransmission. This paper proposes the LLaMA-E, the unified and customized\ninstruction-following language models focusing on diverse e-commerce authoring\ntasks. Specifically, the domain experts create the seed instruction set from\nthe tasks of ads generation, query-enhanced product title rewriting, product\nclassification, purchase intent speculation, and general Q&A.

We compare their\nadvantages and drawbacks using historical medication mining shared task data\nsets from n2c2-2018 challenges. We report the findings we get from these\nfine-tuning experiments such that they can facilitate future research on\naddressing them, for instance, how to combine their outputs, merge such models,\nor improve their overall accuracy by ensemble learning and data augmentation.\nMedMine is part of the M3 Initiative \\url{https://github.com/HECTA-UoM/M3}",

        "summary": "The Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) market is rapidly expanding and\nbecoming more mature. For example, OpenAI's ChatGPT is an advanced large\nlanguage model (LLM) that generates responses for various queries with\nassociated fees. Although these models can deliver satisfactory performance,\nthey are far from perfect. Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities\nand limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity.\nInevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which\ncan be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new\nattack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack.\nSpecifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that\nabstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this\napproach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established\nprice) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established\nprice). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query,\nobtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the\nend user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries'\ntoken length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text\nclassification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted\nqueries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general\nlanguage models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token\nlength by at least 11% without compromising output quality. As a result, the\nprompt abstraction attack enables the adversary to profit without bearing the\ncost of API development and deployment.",

However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed\nthat about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the\nlack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent\nadvances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative\nPre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logicc vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static\nanalysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying\nsolely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false\npositives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a\nversatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability\ntype into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities\nwith GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently\nrecognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static\nconfirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects\nand 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for\ntoken contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like\nWeb3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a\nrecall of over 70%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors.\nGPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01\nUSD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code.

First, despite the impressive performance and utility of large language\nmodels (LLMs), humans achieve their capacity for language after exposure to\nseveral orders of magnitude less data. The fact that young children become\ncompetent, fluent speakers of their native languages with relatively little\nexposure to them is the central mystery of language learning to which Chomsky\ninitially drew attention, and LLMs currently show little promise of solving\nthis mystery. Second, what can the artificial reveal about the natural? Put\nsimply, the implications of LLMs for our understanding of the cognitive\nstructures and mechanisms underlying language and its acquisition are like the\nimplications of airplanes for understanding how birds fly. Third, LLMs cannot\nconstitute scientific theories of language for several reasons, not least of\nwhich is that scientific theories must provide interpretable explanations, not\njust predictions. This leads to our final point: to even determine whether the\nlinguistic and cognitive capabilities of LLMs rival those of humans requires\nexplicating what humans' capacities actually are. In other words, it requires a\nseparate theory of language and cognition; generative linguistics provides\nprecisely such a theory. As such, we conclude that generative linguistics as a\nscientific discipline will remain indispensable throughout the 21st century and\nbeyond.",

We\nfirst manually construct the first class-level code generation benchmark\nClassEval of 100 class-level Python code generation tasks with approximately\n500 person-hours. Based on it, we then perform the first study of 11\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. Based on our results, we\nhave the following main findings. First, we find that all existing LLMs show\nmuch worse performance on class-level code generation compared to on standalone\nmethod-level code generation benchmarks like HumanEval; and the method-level\ncoding ability cannot equivalently reflect the class-level coding ability among\nLLMs. Second, we find that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 still exhibit dominate superior\nthan other LLMs on class-level code generation, and the second-tier models\nincludes Instruct-Starcoder, Instruct-Codegen, and Wizardcoder with very\nsimilar performance. Third, we find that generating the entire class all at\nonce (i.e. holistic generation strategy) is the best generation strategy only\nfor GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, while method-by-method generation (i.e. incremental and\ncompositional) is better strategies for the other models with limited ability\nof understanding long instructions and utilizing the middle information.\nLastly, we find the limited model ability of generating method-dependent code\nand discuss the frequent error types in generated classes.

In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss,\nsupervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning\nperformances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better\nindicator of the model's performance than the model's parameter count. We apply\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and\nempirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model\nperformance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised\ndatasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without\nany human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT\nuses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as\naugmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more\ndistinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more\nfor LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push\nLLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9\\% significantly.",

REAP dataset is\ncollected through searching the title and abstract of 1,168,970 academic\nliteratures from Web of Science. Based on REAP dataset, HouYi model, the first\nLLM for renewable energy, is developed through finetuning general LLMs. HouYi\ndemonstrated powerful academic paper paragraph generation ability in renewable\nenergy field. Experiments show that its ability to generate academic papers on\nrenewable energy is comparable to ChatGPT, slightly outperforms Claude, ERNIE\nBot and SparkDesk, and significantly outperforms open-source LLaMA-13B model.",

Two major approaches for\ninstruction tuning characterize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), which are currently applied to produce the\nbest commercial LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT). To improve the accessibility of LLMs for\nresearch and development efforts, various instruction-tuned open-source LLMs\nhave also been introduced recently, e.g., Alpaca, Vicuna, to name a few.\nHowever, existing open-source LLMs have only been instruction-tuned for English\nand a few popular languages, thus hindering their impacts and accessibility to\nmany other languages in the world. Among a few very recent work to explore\ninstruction tuning for LLMs in multiple languages, SFT has been used as the\nonly approach to instruction-tune LLMs for multiple languages. This has left a\nsignificant gap for fine-tuned LLMs based on RLHF in diverse languages and\nraised important questions on how RLHF can boost the performance of\nmultilingual instruction tuning.

To meet the requirements of these\nnon-Pareto-improving metrics, we follow the most prominent vocabulary\npartition-based watermarking direction, and devise an advanced CTWL method\nnamed Balance-Marking.

In\nrecent years, due to shift to hybrid and remote work, more meetings are moving\nto online Computer Mediated Spaces. This has led to new problems (e.g. more\ntime spent in less engaging meetings) and new opportunities (e.g. automated\ntranscription/captioning and recap support). Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) for dialog summarization have the potential to improve the\nexperience of meetings by reducing individuals' meeting load and increasing the\nclarity and alignment of meeting outputs. Despite this potential, they face\ntechnological limitation due to long transcripts and inability to capture\ndiverse recap needs based on user's context. To address these gaps, we design,\nimplement and evaluate in-context a meeting recap system. We first\nconceptualize two salient recap representations -- important highlights, and a\nstructured, hierarchical minutes view. We develop a system to operationalize\nthe representations with dialogue summarization as its building blocks.\nFinally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the system with seven users in the\ncontext of their work meetings. Our findings show promise in using LLM-based\ndialogue summarization for meeting recap and the need for both representations\nin different contexts. However, we find that LLM-based recap still lacks an\nunderstanding of whats personally relevant to participants, can miss important\ndetails, and mis-attributions can be detrimental to group dynamics. We identify\ncollaboration opportunities such as a shared recap document that a high quality\nrecap enables. We report on implications for designing AI systems to partner\nwith users to learn and improve from natural interactions to overcome the\nlimitations related to personal relevance and summarization quality.",

Therefore, learned evaluation metrics based\non these models are insensitive to negations. In this paper, we propose\nNegBLEURT, a negation-aware version of the BLEURT evaluation metric. For that,\nwe designed a rule-based sentence negation tool and used it to create the\nCANNOT negation evaluation dataset. Based on this dataset, we fine-tuned a\nsentence transformer and an evaluation metric to improve their negation\nsensitivity. Evaluating these models on existing benchmarks shows that our\nfine-tuned models outperform existing metrics on the negated sentences by far\nwhile preserving their base models' performances on other perturbations.",

However, there is still a significant gap in research when it\ncomes to understanding and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in the field of\nmental health. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple\nLLMs on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data, including\nAlpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We conduct a broad range of\nexperiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction\nfine-tuning. The results indicate a promising yet limited performance of LLMs\nwith zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for mental health tasks. More\nimportantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly\nboost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned\nmodels, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform the best prompt design of\nGPT-3.5 (25 and 15 times bigger) by 10.9% on balanced accuracy and the best of\nGPT-4 (250 and 150 times bigger) by 4.8%. They further perform on par with the\nstate-of-the-art task-specific language model. We also conduct an exploratory\ncase study on LLMs' capability on mental health reasoning tasks, illustrating\nthe promising capability of certain models such as GPT-4. We summarize our\nfindings into a set of action guidelines for potential methods to enhance LLMs'\ncapability for mental health tasks. Meanwhile, we also emphasize the important\nlimitations before achieving deployability in real-world mental health\nsettings, such as known racial and gender bias.

To address these issues, we\npropose integrating virtual Game Masters (GMs) into the agent's world model,\ndrawing inspiration from Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). GMs play a\ncrucial role in overseeing information, estimating players' intentions,\nproviding environment descriptions, and offering feedback, compensating for\ncurrent world model deficiencies. To facilitate future explorations for complex\ninteractions, we introduce a benchmark named Tachikuma, comprising a Multiple\ncharacter and novel Object based interaction Estimation (MOE) task and a\nsupporting dataset. MOE challenges models to understand characters' intentions\nand accurately determine their actions within intricate contexts involving\nmulti-character and novel object interactions. Besides, the dataset captures\nlog data from real-time communications during gameplay, providing diverse,\ngrounded, and complex interactions for further explorations. Finally, we\npresent a simple prompting baseline and evaluate its performance, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in enhancing interaction understanding. We hope that our\ndataset and task will inspire further research in complex interactions with\nnatural language, fostering the development of more advanced AI agents.",

Early fake\nprofile identification is crucial to maintaining the platform's integrity since\nit prevents imposters from acquiring the private and sensitive information of\nlegitimate users and from gaining an opportunity to increase their credibility\nfor future phishing and scamming activities. This work uses textual information\nprovided in LinkedIn profiles and introduces the Section and Subsection Tag\nEmbedding (SSTE) method to enhance the discriminative characteristics of these\ndata for distinguishing between legitimate profiles and those created by\nimposters manually or by using an LLM. Additionally, the dearth of a large\npublicly available LinkedIn dataset motivated us to collect 3600 LinkedIn\nprofiles for our research. We will release our dataset publicly for research\npurposes. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large publicly\navailable LinkedIn dataset for fake LinkedIn account detection. Within our\nparadigm, we assess static and contextualized word embeddings, including GloVe,\nFlair, BERT, and RoBERTa. We show that the suggested method can distinguish\nbetween legitimate and fake profiles with an accuracy of about 95% across all\nword embeddings. In addition, we show that SSTE has a promising accuracy for\nidentifying LLM-generated profiles, despite the fact that no LLM-generated\nprofiles were employed during the training phase, and can achieve an accuracy\nof approximately 90% when only 20 LLM-generated profiles are added to the\ntraining set.

In this paper, we propose\nOUTFOX, a framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-text\ndetectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider each\nother's output. In this framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction\nlabels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays\nthat are harder to detect, while the detector uses the adversarially generated\nessays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a\nstrong attacker.

Specifically, we employ in-context learning for GPT\nand fine-tune a range of T5 models to compare the robustness and generalisation\nof pre-training strategies to specialised models. Empirical results show that\nfine-tuned FLAN-T5-large (MathT5) outperforms GPT models on all static and\nout-of-distribution test sets in conventional scores. However, an in-depth\nanalysis reveals that the fine-tuned models are more sensitive to perturbations\ninvolving unseen symbols and (to a lesser extent) changes to equation\nstructure. In addition, we analyse 1.7K equations, and over 200 derivations, to\nhighlight common reasoning errors such as the inclusion of incorrect,\nirrelevant, and redundant equations. Finally, we explore the suitability of\nexisting metrics for evaluating mathematical derivations and find evidence\nthat, while they can capture general properties such as sensitivity to\nperturbations, they fail to highlight fine-grained reasoning errors and\nessential differences between models. Overall, this work demonstrates that\ntraining models on synthetic data may improve their math capabilities beyond\nmuch larger LLMs, but current metrics are not appropriately assessing the\nquality of generated mathematical text.",

        "summary": "Despite the superior performance, Large Language Models~(LLMs) require\nsignificant computational resources for deployment and use. To overcome this\nissue, quantization methods have been widely applied to reduce the memory\nfootprint of LLMs as well as increasing the inference rate. However, a major\nchallenge is that low-bit quantization methods often lead to performance\ndegradation. It is important to understand how quantization impacts the\ncapacity of LLMs. Different from previous studies focused on overall\nperformance, this work aims to investigate the impact of quantization on\n\\emph{emergent abilities}, which are important characteristics that distinguish\nLLMs from small language models. Specially, we examine the abilities of\nin-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and instruction-following in\nquantized LLMs. Our empirical experiments show that these emergent abilities\nstill exist in 4-bit quantization models, while 2-bit models encounter severe\nperformance degradation on the test of these abilities. To improve the\nperformance of low-bit models, we conduct two special experiments: (1)\nfine-gained impact analysis that studies which components (or substructures)\nare more sensitive to quantization, and (2) performance compensation through\nmodel fine-tuning. Our work derives a series of important findings to\nunderstand the impact of quantization on emergent abilities, and sheds lights\non the possibilities of extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs.",

However,\nerroneous generations, such as false predictions, misinformation, and\nhallucination made by LLMs, have also raised severe concerns for the\ntrustworthiness of LLMs', especially in safety-, security- and\nreliability-sensitive scenarios, potentially hindering real-world adoptions.\nWhile uncertainty estimation has shown its potential for interpreting the\nprediction risks made by general machine learning (ML) models, little is known\nabout whether and to what extent it can help explore an LLM's capabilities and\ncounteract its undesired behavior. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we\ninitiate an exploratory study on the risk assessment of LLMs from the lens of\nuncertainty. In particular, we experiment with twelve uncertainty estimation\nmethods and four LLMs on four prominent natural language processing (NLP) tasks\nto investigate to what extent uncertainty estimation techniques could help\ncharacterize the prediction risks of LLMs. Our findings validate the\neffectiveness of uncertainty estimation for revealing LLMs'\nuncertain/non-factual predictions.

We find that uncertainty estimation can potentially uncover buggy\nprograms generated by LLMs. Insights from our study shed light on future design\nand development for reliable LLMs, facilitating further research toward\nenhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs.",

Although it is natural to utilize LLMs to\nassist in understanding molecules represented by SMILES, the exploration of how\nLLMs will impact molecular property prediction is still in its early stage. In\nthis work, we advance towards this objective through two perspectives:\nzero/few-shot molecular classification, and using the new explanations\ngenerated by LLMs as representations of molecules. To be specific, we first\nprompt LLMs to do in-context molecular classification and evaluate their\nperformance. After that, we employ LLMs to generate semantically enriched\nexplanations for the original SMILES and then leverage that to fine-tune a\nsmall-scale LM model for multiple downstream tasks.

In\nthese contexts, it is crucial to ensure that every prediction made by large\nlanguage models is stable, i.e., LLM predictions should be consistent given\nminor differences in the input. This largely falls into the study of certified\nrobust LLMs, i.e., all predictions of LLM are certified to be correct in a\nlocal region around the input. Randomized smoothing has demonstrated great\npotential in certifying the robustness and prediction stability of LLMs.\nHowever, randomized smoothing requires adding noise to the input before model\nprediction, and its certification performance depends largely on the model's\nperformance on corrupted data. As a result, its direct application to LLMs\nremains challenging and often results in a small certification radius. To\naddress this issue, we take advantage of the multitasking nature of LLMs and\npropose to denoise the corrupted inputs with LLMs in a self-denoising manner.\nDifferent from previous works like denoised smoothing, which requires training\na separate model to robustify LLM, our method enjoys far better efficiency and\nflexibility.

Specifically, we first\nidentify the candidates of potential hallucination leveraging the model's logit\noutput values, check their correctness through a validation procedure, mitigate\nthe detected hallucinations, and then continue with the generation process.\nThrough extensive experiments with GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) on the 'article\ngeneration task', we first demonstrate the individual efficacy of our detection\nand mitigation techniques. Specifically, the detection technique achieves a\nrecall of ~88% and the mitigation technique successfully mitigates 57.6% of the\ncorrectly detected hallucinations. Importantly, our mitigation technique does\nnot introduce new hallucinations even in the case of incorrectly detected\nhallucinations, i.e., false positives. Then, we show that the proposed active\ndetection and mitigation approach successfully reduces the hallucinations of\nthe GPT-3.5 model from 47.5% to 14.5% on average. We further demonstrate the\neffectiveness and wide applicability of our approach through additional studies\nincluding performance on different types of questions (multi-hop and false\npremise questions) and with another LLM from a different model family (Vicuna).\nIn summary, our work contributes to improving the reliability and\ntrustworthiness of large language models, a crucial step en route to enabling\ntheir widespread adoption in real-world applications.",

Going beyond\nrecognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they\ncan be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing\nobjectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a\nmodel's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization\noccurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which\ncapabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and\nthen evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's\nClaude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that\nvulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training\nefforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes\nsucceed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models'\nred-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our\nanalysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety\nmechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues\nagainst the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.",

The resolution of complex AI tasks\nthrough the application of acquired knowledge represents a stride toward the\nrealization of artificial general intelligence.

Large\nlanguage models, such as the AI-chatbot ChatGPT, hold potential for offering\nconstructive feedback to tutors in practical settings. Nevertheless, the\naccuracy of AI-generated feedback remains uncertain, with scant research\ninvestigating the ability of models like ChatGPT to deliver effective feedback.\nIn this work-in-progress, we evaluate 30 dialogues generated by GPT-4 in a\ntutor-student setting. We use two different prompting approaches, the zero-shot\nchain of thought and the few-shot chain of thought, to identify specific\ncomponents of effective praise based on five criteria. These approaches are\nthen compared to the results of human graders for accuracy. Our goal is to\nassess the extent to which GPT-4 can accurately identify each praise criterion.\nWe found that both zero-shot and few-shot chain of thought approaches yield\ncomparable results. GPT-4 performs moderately well in identifying instances\nwhen the tutor offers specific and immediate praise. However, GPT-4\nunderperforms in identifying the tutor's ability to deliver sincere praise,\nparticularly in the zero-shot prompting scenario where examples of sincere\ntutor praise statements were not provided.

Since\nevent schemas have complex graph structures, we design an incremental prompting\nand verification method to break down the construction of a complex event graph\ninto three stages: event skeleton construction, event expansion, and\nevent-event relation verification. Compared to directly using LLMs to generate\na linearized graph, our method can generate large and complex schemas with 7.2%\nF1 improvement in temporal relations and 31.0% F1 improvement in hierarchical\nrelations.

Large Language Models\n(LLM) and the derived chatbots, like ChatGPT, have highly improved the natural\nlanguage processing capabilities of AI systems allowing them to process an\nunprecedented amount of unstructured data. However, the ensuing excitement has\nled to negative sentiments, even as AI methods demonstrate remarkable\ncontributions (e.g. in health and genetics).

Although Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) presents a promising\nsolution, its accurate implementation within the context of LLMs remains a\nsignificant hurdle. To address this critical roadblock, our research originates\nfrom a fundamental heuristic insight: tokens within auto-regressive\nLLM-generated text do not equally reflect the underlying meaning. Some tokens\ncarry greater relevance and representativeness than others, owing to the\nphenomenon of \"linguistic redundancy\", wherein a select few keywords suffice to\nconvey the essence of lengthy sentences. Regrettably, existing methodologies\ntreat all tokens with equal importance when estimating uncertainty,\ndisregarding these inherent generative inequalities. Our analysis reveals a\nsignificant issue with state-of-the-art: numerous tokens (and sentences) of\nlimited semantic significance receive equal or even excessive weighting during\nuncertainty estimation. To rectify this bias, we propose to jointly Shifting\nAttention to more Relevant (SAR) components, at both the token- and the\nsentence-levels for accurate uncertainty estimation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments involving a range of popular \"off-the-shelf\" LLMs, including\ninstruction-tuned LLMs such as Vicuna, WizardLM, and LLaMA-2-chat, as well as\npretrained LLMs like OPT and LLaMA, with model sizes extending up to 33B\nparameters.
