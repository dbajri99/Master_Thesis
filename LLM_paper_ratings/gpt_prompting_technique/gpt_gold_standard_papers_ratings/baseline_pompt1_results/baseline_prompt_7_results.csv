Instruction Tuning with GPT-4,Yes.,1.,"""finetuning large language models (LLMs) using machine-generated instruction-following data enables such models to achieve remarkable zero-shot capabilities on new tasks,"" ""We also collect feedback and comparison data from GPT-4 to enable a comprehensive evaluation and reward model training."""
Exploring Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis,yes.,5.,"""However, the growing size and complexity of these models have given rise to new challenges and limitations. Concerns related to model bias, interpretability, data privacy, and environmental impact have become prominent."""
"Whose Text Is It Anyway? Exploring BigCode, Intellectual Property, and Ethics",Yes.,3.,"""Our conclusion outlines obstacles that generative writing assistants create for copyright, and offers a practical road map for copyright analysis for developers, software law experts, and general users to consider in the context of intelligent LLM-powered writing tools."""
Challenges and Limitations of ChatGPT and Other Large Language Models,yes.,5.,"""This article explores the challenges and limitations of large language models, focusing on ChatGPT as a representative example... we also acknowledge the concerns around these models, including their environmental impact, potential for bias, and lack of interpretability... limitations in their understanding of context, difficulty in handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words, and their tendency to generate nonsensical or offensive text."""
Document-Level Machine Translation with Large Language Models,Yes.,3.,"""This work highlights the challenges and opportunities of LLMs for MT, which we hope can inspire the future design and evaluation of LLMs."""
LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,2.,"""using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on both reasoning tasks."""
Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering,Yes.,2.,"""RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news."""
Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement,Yes.,4.,"""the agreement task suffers from several confounders that partially question the conclusions drawn so far."""
On the Role of Negative Precedent in Legal Outcome Prediction,No.,1.,The abstract and title do not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations. The focus is on legal outcome prediction and the performance of models in predicting positive and negative outcomes.
Meta-Learning a Cross-lingual Manifold for Semantic Parsing,No.,1.,"The abstract and title focus on semantic parsing and cross-lingual generalization using a meta-learning algorithm, but do not specifically mention language models (e.g., LMs or LLMs) or their limitations."
OPAL: Ontology-Aware Pretrained Language Model for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue,Yes.,3.,"""The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue."""
Helpful Neighbors: Leveraging Neighbors in Geographic Feature Pronunciation,No.,1.,"""We present a novel architecture that learns to use the pronunciations of neighboring names in order to guess the pronunciation of a given target feature."""
Locally Typical Sampling,yes.,4.,"""Todayâ€™s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (e.g., perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years."""
Improving Low-Resource Cross-lingual Parsing with Expected Statistic Regularization,No.,1.,"The abstract and title focus on Expected Statistic Regularization (ESR) for cross-lingual parsing and syntactic analysis, specifically POS tagging and labeled dependency parsing, without mentioning language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations."
Cross-Lingual Dialogue Dataset Creation via Outline-Based Generation,No.,1.,The paper discusses limitations of multilingual task-oriented dialogue datasets and proposes a new dataset creation method. It does not specifically address language models or their limitations.
Modeling Emotion Dynamics in Song Lyrics with State Space Models,No.,1.,The abstract and title do not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations. The focus is on modeling emotion dynamics in song lyrics using State Space Models (SSMs).
FeelingBlue: A Corpus for Understanding the Emotional Connotation of Color in Context,yes.,1.,"""justifies the color transformation in text via a visual-linguistic model."""
An Empirical Survey of Data Augmentation for Limited Data Learning in NLP,Yes.,3.,"""NLP has achieved great progress in the past decade through the use of neural models and large labeled datasets. The dependence on abundant data prevents NLP models from being applied to low-resource settings or novel tasks where significant time, money, or expertise is required to label massive amounts of textual data."""
Coreference Resolution through a seq2seq Transition-Based System,Yes.,1.,"""We instead present a coreference resolution system that uses a text-to-text (seq2seq) paradigm to predict mentions and links jointly. We implement the coreference system as a transition system and use multilingual T5 as an underlying language model."""
Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications,Yes.,2.,"""In the last few years, the natural language processing community has witnessed advances in neural representations of free texts with transformer-based language models (LMs). Given the importance of knowledge available in tabular data, recent research efforts extend LMs by developing neural representations for structured data."""
