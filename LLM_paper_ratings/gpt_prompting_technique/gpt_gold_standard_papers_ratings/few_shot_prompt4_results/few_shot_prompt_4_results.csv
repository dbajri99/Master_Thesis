FACTOID: FACtual enTailment fOr hallucInation Detection,Yes.,4.,"""However, hallucination is a significant concern."" and ""This paper argues that conventional TE methods are inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs."" and ""aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that contradicts reality."""
Dual Instruction Tuning with Large Language Models for Mathematical Reasoning,Yes.,3.,"""Despite the fine-tuned LLMs, challenges persist, such as incorrect, missing, and redundant steps in CoT generation leading to inaccuracies in answer predictions."""
Boosting Conversational Question Answering with Fine-Grained Retrieval-Augmentation and Self-Check,Yes.,1.,"""Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to generate more reliable and accurate responses, by augmenting large language models (LLMs) with the external vast and dynamic knowledge."" The abstract focuses on improving LLMs with retrieval-augmentation and does not discuss their limitations."
Aligning Large Language Models for Enhancing Psychiatric Interviews through Symptom Delineation and Summarization,Yes.,1.,"""Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have accelerated their usage in various domains... Our experimental results show that appropriately prompted LLMs can achieve high performance on both the symptom delineation task and the summarization task."""
PropTest: Automatic Property Testing for Improved Visual Programming,Yes.,1.,"""Visual Programming has emerged as an alternative to end-to-end black-box visual reasoning models. This type of methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose a problem and generate the source code for an executable computer program."""
LARA: Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Multi-Turn Intent Classification,Yes.,2.,"""Multi-turn intent classification is notably challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational contexts."" and ""LARA tackles these issues by combining a fine-tuned smaller model with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of LLMs."""
CodeS: Natural Language to Code Repository via Multi-Layer Sketch,Yes.,1.,"""The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on code-related tasks has shown the potential of fully automated software development."""
"Synthesize Step-by-Step: Tools, Templates and LLMs as Data Generators for Reasoning-Based Chart VQA",,,
ChatDBG: An AI-Powered Debugging Assistant,Yes.,1.,"""ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers."""
A Chain-of-Thought Prompting Approach with LLMs for Evaluating Students' Formative Assessment Responses in Science,Yes.,2.,"""A systematic analysis of our method's pros and cons sheds light on the potential for human-in-the-loop techniques to enhance automated grading for open-ended science assessments."""
Summing Up the Facts: Additive Mechanisms Behind Factual Recall in LLMs,Yes.,1.,"""We find that the mechanistic story behind factual recall is more complex than previously thought."" The abstract focuses on understanding how LLMs store and retrieve knowledge, particularly in the context of factual recall, but it does not discuss limitations of LLMs in detail."
CPSDBench: A Large Language Model Evaluation Benchmark and Baseline for Chinese Public Security Domain,Yes.,2.,"""Through the in-depth analysis and evaluation conducted in this research, we not only enhance our understanding of the performance strengths and limitations of existing models in addressing public security issues but also provide references for the future development of more accurate and customized LLM models targeted at applications in this field."""
GraphTranslator: Aligning Graph Model to Large Language Model for Open-ended Tasks,Yes.,1.,"""Although several methods applying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handle the pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or as a standalone predictor."""
