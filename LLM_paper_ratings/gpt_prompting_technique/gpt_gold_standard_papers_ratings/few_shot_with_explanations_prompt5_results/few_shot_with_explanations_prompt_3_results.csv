To Diverge or Not to Diverge: A Morphosyntactic Perspective on Machine Translation vs Human Translation,No.,N/A.,"The abstract discusses machine translations (MTs) and human translations (HTs) with a focus on morphosyntactic divergence, without mentioning language models (LLMs or LMs)."
What Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Know About Words?,No.,N/A.,The abstract discusses self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) and does not mention language models (LLMs or LMs).
Are Character-level Translations Worth the Wait? Comparing ByT5 and mT5 for Machine Translation,Yes.,2.,"""We conclude by assessing the efficiency tradeoff of byte models, suggesting their usage in non-time-critical scenarios to boost translation quality."""
Geographic Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models,Yes.,1.,"""While pretrained language models (PLMs) have been shown to possess a plethora of linguistic knowledge, the existing body of research has largely neglected extralinguistic knowledge, which is generally difficult to obtain by pretraining on text alone."""
Do Text Simplification Systems Preserve Meaning? A Human Evaluation via Reading Comprehension,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention LLMs or any specific type of language models.
Text-to-OverpassQL: A Natural Language Interface for Complex Geodata Querying of OpenStreetMap,Yes.,2.,"""The detailed evaluation reveals strengths and weaknesses of the considered learning strategies, laying the foundations for further research into the Text-to-OverpassQL task."""
Eliciting the Translation Ability of Large Language Models via Multilingual Finetuning with Translation Instructions,Yes.,1.,"""Firstly, we show that multilingual LLMs have stronger translation abilities than previously demonstrated."""
Semantics of Multiword Expressions in Transformer-Based Models: A Survey,Yes.,5.,"""We overall find that they capture MWE semantics inconsistently, as shown by reliance on surface patterns and memorized information."" and ""Our findings overall question the ability of transformer models to robustly capture fine-grained semantics."""
Extracting Social Determinants of Health from Pediatric Patient Notes Using Large Language Models: Novel Corpus and Methods,Yes.,1.,"""evaluate the automatic extraction of detailed SDoH representations using fine-tuned and in-context learning methods with Large Language Models (LLMs)."""
Fairness in Large Language Models: A Taxonomic Survey,,,
Algorithmic Collusion by Large Language Models,Yes.,4.,"""LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers,"" and ""variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions ('prompts') may increase collusion."""
Recover: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Failure Detection and Recovery,Yes.,3.,"""Traditional approaches rely on the availability of extensive data or a tight set of constraints, while more recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to verify task steps and replan accordingly. However, these methods often operate offline, necessitating scene resets and incurring in high costs."""
Can Language Models Recognize Convincing Arguments?,Yes.,1.,"""The remarkable and ever-increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their potential misuse for creating personalized, convincing misinformation and propaganda."""
WavLLM: Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Large Language Model,Yes.,3.,"""effectively integrating listening capabilities into LLMs poses significant challenges, particularly with respect to generalizing across varied contexts and executing complex auditory tasks."""
RQ-RAG: Learning to Refine Queries for Retrieval Augmented Generation,Yes.,5.,"""Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but are prone to generating inaccurate or hallucinatory responses. This limitation stems from their reliance on vast pretraining datasets, making them susceptible to errors in unseen scenarios."""
CHOPS: CHat with custOmer Profile Systems for Customer Service with LLMs,Yes.,5.,"""current LLM-based customer service models have limited integration with customer profiles and lack the operational capabilities necessary for effective service. Moreover, existing API integrations emphasize diversity over the precision and error avoidance essential in real-world customer service scenarios."""
NumeroLogic: Number Encoding for Enhanced LLMs' Numerical Reasoning,Yes.,5.,"""Language models struggle with handling numerical data and performing arithmetic operations."" and ""We hypothesize that this limitation can be partially attributed to non-intuitive textual numbers representation."""
Can LLMs Master Math? Investigating Large Language Models on Math Stack Exchange,Yes.,5.,"""This paper explores the current limitations of LLMs in navigating complex mathematical problem-solving.
