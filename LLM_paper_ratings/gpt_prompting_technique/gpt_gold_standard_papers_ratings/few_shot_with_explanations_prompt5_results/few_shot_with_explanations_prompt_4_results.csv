A Survey of using Large Language Models for Generating Infrastructure as Code,Yes.,2.,"""Finally, we conclude by presenting the challenges in this area and highlighting the scope for future research."""
Injecting New Knowledge into Large Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning,Yes.,3.,"""adapting these models to incorporate new, out-of-domain knowledge remains a challenge, particularly for facts and events that occur after the model's knowledge cutoff date."""
"DataAgent: Evaluating Large Language Models' Ability to Answer Zero-Shot, Natural Language Queries",Yes.,1.,"""Our findings demonstrate great potential for leveraging Large Language Models for low-level, zero-shot data analysis."""
On-the-fly Definition Augmentation of LLMs for Biomedical NER,Yes.,4.,"""Despite their general capabilities, LLMs still struggle on biomedical NER tasks, which are difficult due to the presence of specialized terminology and lack of training data."""
ITCMA: A Generative Agent Based on a Computational Consciousness Structure,Yes.,4.,"""Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in tasks requiring understanding implicit instructions and applying common-sense knowledge. In such scenarios, LLMs may require multiple attempts to achieve human-level performance, potentially leading to inaccurate responses or inferences in practical environments, affecting their long-term consistency and"
Retrieval-Enhanced Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Language Models,Yes.,4.,"""Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in question-answering tasks but often struggle to integrate real-time knowledge updates, leading to potentially outdated or inaccurate responses."" and ""This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with multi-hop questions since they require LLMs to update and integrate multiple knowledge"
Mixed Preference Optimization: Reinforcement Learning with Data Selection and Better Reference Model,Yes.,4.,"""LLMs can inherit harmful biases and produce outputs that are not aligned with human values."""
