LLMs for Relational Reasoning: How Far are We?,Yes.,5.,"""Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks."" and ""Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art L"
Large Language Models in Plant Biology,Yes.,1.,"""This review outlines the different types of LLMs and showcases their recent uses in biology. Since LLMs have not yet been embraced by the plant community, we also cover how these models can be deployed for the plant kingdom."""
From LLM to Conversational Agent: A Memory Enhanced Architecture with Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,1.,"""This paper introduces RAISE (Reasoning and Acting through Scratchpad and Examples), an advanced architecture enhancing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into conversational agents."""
GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience,,,
Large Language Models for Generative Information Extraction: A Survey,Yes.,1.,"""Recently, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, allowing for generalization across various domains and tasks."""
Building Efficient Universal Classifiers with Natural Language Inference,Yes.,1.,"""Many users, however, do not need the broad capabilities of generative LLMs when they only want to automate a classification task."""
Large Language Models for Conducting Advanced Text Analytics Information Systems Research,,,
LLMs with User-defined Prompts as Generic Data Operators for Reliable Data Processing,Yes.,3.,"""we summarize the challenges and opportunities introduced by LLMs to provide a complete view of this design pattern for more discussions."""
Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Reranking with Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages,Yes.,3.,"""Despite their successful implementations, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in low-resource languages."""
Comparative Analysis of Deep Natural Networks and Large Language Models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,,,
LlaMaVAE: Guiding Large Language Model Generation via Continuous Latent Sentence Spaces,Yes.,1.,"""To combine the controllability of VAE latent spaces with the state-of-the-art performance of recent large language models (LLMs)."""
A Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for Code Documentation Generation,Yes.,1.,"""This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generation of code documentation."""
TigerBot: An Open Multilingual Multitask LLM,Yes.,1.,"""We release and introduce the TigerBot family of large language models (LLMs), consisting of base and chat models, sized from 7, 13, 70 and 180 billion parameters."""
Efficiently Programming Large Language Models using SGLang,Yes.,2.,"""However, efficient systems for programming and executing these applications are lacking."""
Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey,Yes.,3.,"""While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions)."" and ""it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized"
Still No Lie Detector for Language Models: Probing Empirical and Conceptual Roadblocks,Yes.,5.,"""We provide empirical results that show that these methods fail to generalize in very basic ways."" and ""Thus, there is still no lie-detector for LLMs."""
