Title,Talks about LLMs,Rate,Evidence
Instruction Tuning with GPT-4,Yes.,1.,"""In this paper, we present the first attempt to use GPT-4 to generate instruction-following data for LLM finetuning."""
Exploring Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis,Yes.,5.,"""However, the growing size and complexity of these models have given rise to new challenges and limitations. Concerns related to model bias, interpretability, data privacy, and environmental impact have become prominent."""
"Whose Text Is It Anyway? Exploring BigCode, Intellectual Property, and Ethics",Yes.,2.,"""Our conclusion outlines obstacles that generative writing assistants create for copyright, and offers a practical road map for copyright analysis for developers, software law experts, and general users to consider in the context of intelligent LLM-powered writing tools."""
Challenges and Limitations of ChatGPT and Other Large Language Models,Yes.,5.,"""This article explores the challenges and limitations of large language models, focusing on ChatGPT as a representative example,"" and ""including their environmental impact, potential for bias, and lack of interpretability,"" and ""limitations in their understanding of context, difficulty in handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words, and their tendency"
Document-Level Machine Translation with Large Language Models,,,
LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,1.,"""The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by finetuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca)."""
Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention language models (LLMs or LMs) or their limitations. It focuses on the RAG model and its domain adaptation capabilities.
Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement,Yes.,3.,"""the agreement task suffers from several confounders that partially question the conclusions drawn so far."""
On the Role of Negative Precedent in Legal Outcome Prediction,No.,N/A.,"The abstract does not mention language models, LLMs, or any related concepts. It focuses on legal outcome prediction and the performance of models in predicting positive and negative outcomes."
Meta-Learning a Cross-lingual Manifold for Semantic Parsing,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention LLMs or any specific limitations related to them. It focuses on semantic parsing and cross-lingual generalization.
OPAL: Ontology-Aware Pretrained Language Model for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue,Yes.,1.,"""The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue."""
Helpful Neighbors: Leveraging Neighbors in Geographic Feature Pronunciation,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) at all.
Locally Typical Sampling,Yes.,5.,"""Today’s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (e.g., perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years."""
Improving Low-Resource Cross-lingual Parsing with Expected Statistic Regularization,No.,N/A.,The abstract focuses on Expected Statistic Regularization (ESR) for cross-lingual parsing and does not mention language models (LLMs or LMs).
Cross-Lingual Dialogue Dataset Creation via Outline-Based Generation,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention LLMs or any specific type of language models.
Modeling Emotion Dynamics in Song Lyrics with State Space Models,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention language models or large language models.
FeelingBlue: A Corpus for Understanding the Emotional Connotation of Color in Context,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention language models (LLMs or LMs) or their limitations.
An Empirical Survey of Data Augmentation for Limited Data Learning in NLP,No.,N/A.,The abstract does not mention LLMs or any specific type of language models. It focuses on data augmentation methods for NLP in limited labeled data settings.
Coreference Resolution through a seq2seq Transition-Based System,,,
Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications,Yes.,1.,"""In the last few years, the natural language processing community has witnessed advances in neural representations of free texts with transformer-based language models (LMs)."""
