Title,Talks about LLMs,Rate,Evidence
Instruction Tuning with GPT-4,Yes.,1.,"The abstract discusses using GPT-4 to generate instruction-following data for fine-tuning large language models and mentions the superior performance of the models. However, it does not mention any limitations of large language models."
Exploring Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis,Yes.,4.,"""However, the growing size and complexity of these models have given rise to new challenges and limitations. Concerns related to model bias, interpretability, data privacy, and environmental impact have become prominent."""
"Whose Text Is It Anyway? Exploring BigCode, Intellectual Property, and Ethics",Yes.,2.,"""This position paper probes the copyright interests of open data sets used to train large language models (LLMs)."" and ""Our conclusion outlines obstacles that generative writing assistants create for copyright, and offers a practical road map for copyright analysis for developers, software law experts, and general users to consider in the context of intelligent LLM-powered writing tools."""
Challenges and Limitations of ChatGPT and Other Large Language Models,Yes.,5.,"""This article explores the challenges and limitations of large language models, focusing on ChatGPT as a representative example. [...] we also acknowledge the concerns around these models, including their environmental impact, potential for bias, and lack of interpretability. [...] limitations in their understanding of context, difficulty in handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words, and their tendency to generate nonsensical or offensive text"
Document-Level Machine Translation with Large Language Models,Yes.,2.,"""This work highlights the challenges and opportunities of LLMs for MT, which we hope can inspire the future design and evaluation of LLMs."""
LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,1.,The abstract primarily discusses the success and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). It does not mention any limitations of LLMs.
Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering,Yes.,2.,"""RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news."""
Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement,Yes.,2.,"The paper discusses transformers' ability to predict subject-verb and object-past participle agreements and mentions that the agreement task suffers from several confounders, which partially question the conclusions drawn so far. This indicates some acknowledgment of limitations but does not focus extensively on them."
On the Role of Negative Precedent in Legal Outcome Prediction,no.,1.,"The abstract does not mention large language models (LLMs) at all. It focuses on legal outcome prediction and the performance gap in predicting positive versus negative outcomes, but there is no discussion of LLMs or their limitations."
Meta-Learning a Cross-lingual Manifold for Semantic Parsing,No.,1.,The abstract does not mention large language models or their limitations. It focuses on cross-lingual semantic parsing and meta-learning algorithms.
OPAL: Ontology-Aware Pretrained Language Model for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue,Yes.,2.,"""The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem..."""
Helpful Neighbors: Leveraging Neighbors in Geographic Feature Pronunciation,No.,1.,The abstract does not mention large language models or their limitations. The focus is on a novel architecture for pronunciation prediction and its applications to geographic names and historical linguistics.
Locally Typical Sampling,Yes.,2.,"""Today’s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (e.g., perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years."""
Improving Low-Resource Cross-lingual Parsing with Expected Statistic Regularization,No.,1.,The abstract does not mention large language models (LLMs) or their limitations. It focuses on Expected Statistic Regularization (ESR) for low-resource cross-lingual parsing.
Cross-Lingual Dialogue Dataset Creation via Outline-Based Generation,No.,1.,The abstract focuses on the creation of a multilingual task-oriented dialogue dataset and discusses the limitations of current multilingual ToD datasets. It does not mention large language models or their limitations.
Modeling Emotion Dynamics in Song Lyrics with State Space Models,No.,1.,"The abstract does not mention large language models or their limitations. It focuses on emotion dynamics in song lyrics using State Space Models and does not discuss pre-trained transformer-based language models or multimodal, visual language models."
FeelingBlue: A Corpus for Understanding the Emotional Connotation of Color in Context,no.,1.,The abstract does not mention large language models (LLMs) or their limitations. The focus is on the emotional connotation of color in context and the creation of a multimodal dataset for this purpose.
An Empirical Survey of Data Augmentation for Limited Data Learning in NLP,No.,1.,The abstract does not mention large language models (LLMs) or their limitations. It focuses on data augmentation methods for NLP in low-resource settings.
Coreference Resolution through a seq2seq Transition-Based System,Yes.,1.,"The abstract mentions the use of a multilingual T5 language model for coreference resolution and highlights the state-of-the-art performance achieved. However, it does not discuss any limitations of large language models."
Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications,Yes.,1.,The abstract mentions transformer-based language models (LMs) and their extension to structured data but does not discuss any limitations of these models. The focus is on surveying models and applications rather than addressing their limitations.
