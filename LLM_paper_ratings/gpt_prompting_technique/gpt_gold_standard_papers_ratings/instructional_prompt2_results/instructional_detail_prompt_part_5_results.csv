Large Language Models Are Neurosymbolic Reasoners,Yes.,1.,The abstract discusses the use of LLMs as symbolic reasoners and their application in text-based games but does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs.
LLMs for Relational Reasoning: How Far are We?,Yes.,4.,"""it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks,"" ""the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning,"" ""state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization."""
Large Language Models in Plant Biology,Yes.,1.,The abstract mentions the capabilities and applications of LLMs in plant biology but does not discuss any limitations or challenges related to LLMs. The focus is on their potential uses and not on their limitations.
From LLM to Conversational Agent: A Memory Enhanced Architecture with Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,1.,The abstract focuses on introducing an advanced architecture (RAISE) to enhance the integration of LLMs into conversational agents. It does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs.
GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience,Yes.,1.,"The abstract discusses the development and specialization of a large language model (LLM) for geoscience but does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs. The focus is on the success and application of LLMs in geoscience, as well as the technical details of creating GeoGalactica."
Large Language Models for Generative Information Extraction: A Survey,Yes.,1.,"""Recently, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, allowing for generalization across various domains and tasks. As a result, numerous works have been proposed to harness abilities of LLMs and offer viable solutions for IE tasks based on a generative paradigm. To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and exploration of LLM efforts for IE tasks"
Building Efficient Universal Classifiers with Natural Language Inference,yes.,3.,"""Many users, however, do not need the broad capabilities of generative LLMs when they only want to automate a classification task. Smaller BERT-like models can also learn universal tasks, which allow them to do any text classification task without requiring fine-tuning (zeroshot classification) or to learn new tasks with only a few examples (fewshot), while being significantly more"
Large Language Models for Conducting Advanced Text Analytics Information Systems Research,yes.,3.,"""We also outline potential challenges and limitations in adopting LLMs for IS."""
LLMs with User-defined Prompts as Generic Data Operators for Reliable Data Processing,Yes.,3.,"""We illustrate these advantages with examples in different data processing tasks. Furthermore, we summarize the challenges and opportunities introduced by LLMs to provide a complete view of this design pattern for more discussions."""
Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Reranking with Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages,Yes.,3.,"""Despite their successful implementations, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in low-resource languages... While reranking remains most effective in English, our results reveal that cross-lingual reranking may be competitive with reranking in African languages depending on the multilingual capability of the LLM."""
Comparative Analysis of Deep Natural Networks and Large Language Models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,Yes.,3.,"""the existing models for ABSA face three main challenges, including domain-specificity, reliance on labeled data, and a lack of exploration into the potential of newer large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, PaLM, and T5."""
LlaMaVAE: Guiding Large Language Model Generation via Continuous Latent Sentence Spaces,Yes.,1.,The abstract discusses integrating VAEs with LLMs for better text generation control but does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs.
A Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for Code Documentation Generation,Yes.,2.,"The abstract mentions that ""file level documentation had a considerably worse performance across all parameters (except for time taken) as compared to inline and function level documentation."" This is a brief mention of a limitation related to the performance of LLMs in a specific context."
TigerBot: An Open Multilingual Multitask LLM,Yes.,1.,"The abstract discusses the development, performance, and contributions of the TigerBot family of large language models (LLMs). It highlights the improvements in performance over other models and the significance of their release to the open-source community. However, it does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs."
Efficiently Programming Large Language Models using SGLang,Yes.,2.,"""However, efficient systems for programming and executing these applications are lacking."""
Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey,Yes.,3.,"""While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs...although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning)."""
Still No Lie Detector for Language Models: Probing Empirical and Conceptual Roadblocks,Yes.,4.,"""We provide empirical results that show that these methods fail to generalize in very basic ways."" ""We then argue that, even if LLMs have beliefs, these methods are unlikely to be successful for conceptual reasons."" ""Thus, there is still no lie-detector for LLMs."" ""We consider some recent arguments aiming to show that LLMs cannot have beliefs."" """
SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs,Yes.,2.,"""In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos."""
