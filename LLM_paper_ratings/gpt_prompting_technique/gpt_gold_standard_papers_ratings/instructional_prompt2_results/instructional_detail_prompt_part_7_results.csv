Exploring Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis,Yes.,4.,"""However, the growing size and complexity of these models have given rise to new challenges and limitations. Concerns related to model bias, interpretability, data privacy, and environmental impact have become prominent."""
"Whose Text Is It Anyway? Exploring BigCode, Intellectual Property, and Ethics",Yes.,3.,"""This position paper probes the copyright interests of open data sets used to train large language models (LLMs)... Our conclusion outlines obstacles that generative writing assistants create for copyright."""
Challenges and Limitations of ChatGPT and Other Large Language Models,Yes.,5.,"""This article explores the challenges and limitations of large language models, focusing on ChatGPT as a representative example... concerns around these models, including their environmental impact, potential for bias, and lack of interpretability... limitations in their understanding of context, difficulty in handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words, and their tendency to generate nonsensical or offensive text."""
Document-Level Machine Translation with Large Language Models,Yes.,3.,"""This work highlights the challenges and opportunities of LLMs for MT, which we hope can inspire the future design and evaluation of LLMs."""
LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Yes.,1.,"The abstract discusses the success and fine-tuning methods of LLMs, specifically focusing on adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). It does not mention any limitations or challenges related to LLMs."
Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering,Yes.,2.,"""RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news."""
Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement,Yes.,2.,"""the agreement task suffers from several confounders that partially question the conclusions drawn so far"" indicates a brief mention of a limitation related to transformers' handling of syntactic tasks."
On the Role of Negative Precedent in Legal Outcome Prediction,No.,1.,The abstract and title focus on legal outcome prediction and the asymmetry in predicting positive versus negative outcomes. There is no mention of language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations.
Meta-Learning a Cross-lingual Manifold for Semantic Parsing,No.,1.,"The abstract discusses cross-lingual semantic parsing, meta-learning algorithms, and generalization across languages. It does not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations."
OPAL: Ontology-Aware Pretrained Language Model for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue,Yes.,3.,"""The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue."""
Helpful Neighbors: Leveraging Neighbors in Geographic Feature Pronunciation,no.,1.,The abstract discusses a novel architecture for leveraging neighboring geographic feature pronunciations and its application to Japanese place names and cognate reflex prediction. There is no mention of language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations.
Locally Typical Sampling,Yes.,3.,"""Today’s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (e.g., perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years."""
Improving Low-Resource Cross-lingual Parsing with Expected Statistic Regularization,No.,1.,"The abstract discusses Expected Statistic Regularization (ESR) for semi-supervised learning on low-resource datasets, focusing on cross-lingual transfer for syntactic analysis like POS tagging and labeled dependency parsing. There is no mention of language models (LLMs) or their limitations."
Cross-Lingual Dialogue Dataset Creation via Outline-Based Generation,No.,1.,"The abstract does not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or discuss their limitations. It focuses on the creation and evaluation of a multilingual task-oriented dialogue dataset and the limitations of existing datasets, but not on LLMs specifically."
Modeling Emotion Dynamics in Song Lyrics with State Space Models,No.,1.,The abstract and title focus on modeling emotion dynamics in song lyrics using State Space Models (SSM) and do not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations.
FeelingBlue: A Corpus for Understanding the Emotional Connotation of Color in Context,No.,1.,The abstract discusses the emotional connotation of color in context and introduces a new dataset and task related to this topic. It does not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations.
An Empirical Survey of Data Augmentation for Limited Data Learning in NLP,No.,1.,The abstract discusses data augmentation for NLP in low-resource settings and does not mention language models (LMs or LLMs) or their limitations.
Coreference Resolution through a seq2seq Transition-Based System,Yes.,1.,"""We implement the coreference system as a transition system and use multilingual T5 as an underlying language model."""
Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications,Yes.,1.,"""In the last few years, the natural language processing community has witnessed advances in neural representations of free texts with transformer-based language models (LMs). Given the importance of knowledge available in tabular data, recent research efforts extend LMs by developing neural representations for structured data. In this article, we present a survey that analyzes these efforts. We first abstract the different systems according to a"
