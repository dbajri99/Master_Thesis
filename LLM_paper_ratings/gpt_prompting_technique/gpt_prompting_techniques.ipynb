    "    Paper: \"In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%\"\n",

    "    Paper: \"The exponential growth of digital content has generated massive textual datasets, necessitating advanced analytical approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text-based Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist IS research in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text-based IS research. We conducted three case studies in business intelligence using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application across several IS research contexts. We also outline potential challenges and limitations in adopting LLMs for IS. By offering a systematic approach and evidence of its utility, our TAISR framework contributes to future IS research streams looking to incorporate powerful LLMs for text analytics.\"\n",

    "    Title: Meta-Reasoning: Semantics-Symbol Deconstruction for Large Language Models\n",
    "    Paper: \"Neural-symbolic methods have demonstrated efficiency in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods mainly rely on syntactically mapping natural languages to complete formal languages like Python and SQL. Those methods require that reasoning tasks be convertible into programs, which cater to the computer execution mindset and deviate from human reasoning habits. To broaden symbolic methods' applicability and adaptability in the real world, we propose the Meta-Reasoning from a linguistic perspective. This method empowers LLMs to deconstruct reasoning-independent semantic information into generic symbolic representations, thereby efficiently capturing more generalized reasoning knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on more than ten datasets encompassing conventional reasoning tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning, and the more complex interactive reasoning tasks like theory-of-mind reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-Reasoning significantly enhances in-context reasoning accuracy, learning efficiency, out-of-domain generalization, and output stability compared to the Chain-of-Thought technique.

    "    Paper: \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.\"\n",

    "    Paper: \"While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well they use longer context. We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models.\"\n",

SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%\"\n",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text-based Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist IS research in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text-based IS research. We conducted three case studies in business intelligence using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application across several IS research contexts.

    "    Title: Meta-Reasoning: Semantics-Symbol Deconstruction for Large Language Models\n",
    "    Paper: \"Neural-symbolic methods have demonstrated efficiency in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods mainly rely on syntactically mapping natural languages to complete formal languages like Python and SQL. Those methods require that reasoning tasks be convertible into programs, which cater to the computer execution mindset and deviate from human reasoning habits. To broaden symbolic methods' applicability and adaptability in the real world, we propose the Meta-Reasoning from a linguistic perspective. This method empowers LLMs to deconstruct reasoning-independent semantic information into generic symbolic representations, thereby efficiently capturing more generalized reasoning knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on more than ten datasets encompassing conventional reasoning tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning, and the more complex interactive reasoning tasks like theory-of-mind reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-Reasoning significantly enhances in-context reasoning accuracy, learning efficiency, out-of-domain generalization, and output stability compared to the Chain-of-Thought technique.

    "    Paper: \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.\"\n",

    "    Paper: \"While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well they use longer context. We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models.\"\n",

    "#### Simplifying Evaluation Metrics for Large Language Model Ratings\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "The aim is to simplify the evaluation of ratings for papers discussing large language models (LLMs) by grouping the original five rating classes into three distinct classes. This approach can help simplify the evaluation and make it more robust, especially when the distinctions between certain ratings (like 2 and 3) are not very clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale\n",
    "The original five rating classes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rating 1: Papers that do not talk about LLMs or do not mention any limitations of LLMs.\n",
    "##### Rating 2: Papers that mention one limitation of LLMs very briefly.\n",
    "##### Rating 3: Papers that mention limitations of LLMs, but not as the main focus. These limitations are discussed superficially or as secondary points.\n",
    "##### Rating 4: Papers that provide multiple significant limitations of LLMs. The limitations are discussed in detail alongside other topics.\n",
    "##### Rating 5: Papers where the entire abstract or most sentences focus on the limitations and challenges of LLMs, discussing them in detail with strong wording indicating serious issues.\n",
    "Given this, we propose the following grouping into three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class 0: Papers that should be rated as 1. These papers do not talk about LLMs or do not mention any limitations of LLMs.\n",
    "##### Class 1: Papers that should be rated as 2 or 3. These papers mention limitations of LLMs but not in detail and not as the main focus. The limitations are secondary points in the discussion.\n",
    "##### Class 2: Papers that should be rated as 4 or 5. These papers primarily focus on the limitations of LLMs, discussing them in detail throughout the abstract.\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "To implement this grouping, we convert the ratings into three classes using a predefined mapping and then calculate the macro F1 score for each prompting technique compared to the human-annotated ground truth. This ensures the evaluation metrics are independent and accurately reflect the performance of each technique."
