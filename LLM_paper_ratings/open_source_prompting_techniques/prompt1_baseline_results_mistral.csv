The authors also find that while models can generate text with large-scale structure that is as novel or more novel than human-generated text, they still sometimes copy substantially for local structure. This highlights a major limitation of LLMs: their tendency to memorize and reproduce training data rather than generating truly novel text based on abstract linguistic knowledge."

It does, however, propose a method for improving the quality of pseudo answer labels using a self-training paradigm, which relies on the ability of language models to accurately predict intent labels. This could be seen as a limitation of language models if their ability to accurately predict intent labels is not high enough, but the paper does not discuss this specifically."
Benchmarking the Generation of Fact Checking Explanations,Yes.,1,"""We focus on summarization approaches over unstructured knowledge (i.e., news articles) and we experiment with several extractive and abstractive strategies."" ""Results show that in justification production summarization benefits from the claim information."""
T 2 -NER: A Two-Stage Span-Based Framework for Unified Named Entity Recognition with Templates,No.,N/A.,This paper is about named entity recognition and does not mention language models at all.
PASTA: A Dataset for Modeling PArticipant STAtes in Narratives,Yes.,5,"The paper states that ""today’s LLMs can reason about states to some degree, but there is large room for improvement, especially in problems requiring access and ability to reason with diverse types of knowledge."""
U-CORE: A Unified Deep Cluster-wise Contrastive Framework for Open Relation Extraction,No.,N/A.,The paper does not mention language models. It focuses on Open Relation Extraction and proposes a unified framework for Zero-shot and Unsupervised ORE using techniques from Contrastive Learning and Clustering.
In-Context Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,Yes.,3,"The paper mentions the problem of factually inaccurate text generation as a limitation of LMs, and shows that In-Context RALM can mitigate this problem. Additionally, the paper notes that existing RALM approaches complicate deployment, which could be seen as a limitation of the more complex LLMs."
Learning to Paraphrase Sentences to Different Complexity Levels,Yes.,3,"""Finally, we establish how a handful of Large Language Models perform on these tasks under a zero-shot setting."" This suggests that the limitations of LLMs are discussed in the context of their performance on specific tasks."
Direct Speech Translation for Automatic Subtitling,No.,N/A.,"The paper does not mention large language models or their limitations. It discusses the task of automatic subtitling and proposes a new model for it, but it does not involve language modeling in any way."
How Abstract Is Linguistic Generalization in Large Language Models? Experiments with Argument Structure,Yes.,5,"The paper shows that LLMs fail to generalize abstract relationships between contexts that were not observed during pre-training, despite their success in generalizing relationships that were seen. This is a significant limitation as it highlights the need for more abstract and diverse pre-training data to improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs."
"Multi 3 WOZ: A Multilingual, Multi-Domain, Multi-Parallel Dataset for Training and Evaluating Culturally Adapted Task-Oriented Dialog Systems",No.,N/A.,"None in the provided abstract. The paper is about creating a multilingual, multi-domain, multi-parallel ToD dataset. It mentions some limitations of existing ToD datasets but does not mention language models specifically or their limitations."
Can Authorship Representation Learning Capture Stylistic Features?,Yes.,3,"The paper discusses the use of large text corpora for learning authorship representations, which implies the use of large language models for processing and encoding the text data. However, the limitations are that the paper only focuses on text data and does not consider other modalities, and the style transfer application mentioned in the conclusion assumes that the representations captured are purely stylistic, which may not be the case."
Optimal Transport Posterior Alignment for Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing,No.,N/A.,"None. The paper discusses cross-lingual semantic parsing and the use of optimal transport for improving parsing performance, but it does not mention or discuss large language models."
