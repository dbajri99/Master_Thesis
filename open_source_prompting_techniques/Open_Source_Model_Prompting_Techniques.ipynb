We demonstrate that mBERT achieves strong transfer learning performance across a wide range of monolingual and multilingual NLP tasks, outperforming previous multilingual models by a significant margin. We also show that mBERT is effective in a zero-shot multilingual setting, where the model is tested on a target language it has never seen before.

In this paper, we perform a comparative study on the effectiveness of various multimodal transformers for semantic segmentation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including the ViLBERT, LXMERT, UNITER, and MM-DETR, on the COCO dataset. Our results show that the MM-DETR outperforms all other models in terms of mIoU, demonstrating its superiority in handling multimodal data.

This allows our model to learn to encode the relationship between the text and visual inputs, enabling it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on various multimodal datasets, including image captioning, visual question answering, and visual reasoning.

In this work, we present a case study on the limitations of instructable language models, which are models that generate text based on explicit instructions. We examine two scenarios: generating toxic content and generating factually incorrect content. We find that instructable language models can generate toxic content with high confidence even when given seemingly innocuous instructions, and they can generate factually incorrect content when the instructions are ambiguous or incomplete. We also find that these limitations can be mitigated by incorporating additional safety mechanisms, such as filtering, fact-checking, and diversity control.

With the recent success of transformers in natural language processing, researchers have started to investigate their applicability in time series analysis. In this survey, we provide an overview of transformer-based models for time series data analysis. We discuss the unique challenges and requirements of time series data, such as temporal dependencies and stationarity, and how transformers address them. We also compare various transformer architectures and their performance on time series datasets.

      "     Paper: The recent trend in large language models (LLMs) has led to the development of increasingly larger models. However, it remains unclear whether scaling LLMs indefinitely will lead to better performance. In this study, we compare LLM-17 and T5-30B, two large LLMs, to understand the limits of LLM scaling. We find that while LLM-17 performs well on various tasks, T5-30B shows only marginal improvements despite its larger size. Our analysis reveals that the performance gap between the two models can be attributed to several factors, including data sparsity, model architecture, and computational efficiency. We conclude that while LLM scaling can lead to some improvements, it may not be a silver bullet for achieving better performance on all tasks.\n",

In this work, we explore the limits of few-shot learning in PLMs by studying their performance on a diverse set of tasks with varying degrees of similarity to the tasks they were pretrained on. We find that PLMs struggle to generalize to tasks that are significantly different from their pretraining tasks, even when the number of training examples is large. Furthermore, we observe that PLMs perform better when the tasks are similar to their pretraining tasks, indicating that their few-shot learning capabilities are largely dependent on the similarity between the pretraining and fine-tuning tasks.

The NTM-LM is an extension of the popular LSTM-LM, which uses an LSTM to model the context of a sequence of words. The NTM-LM replaces the LSTM with an NTM, which maintains a memory buffer of past context words and can selectively read and write to this buffer based on the current input word.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Temporal Text Classification (TTC) method using LSTM networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-LSTM) cells, which can capture long-term dependencies effectively. Our method uses a multi-scale attention mechanism to capture the most relevant features from the input sequence, and a hierarchical gating mechanism to control the information flow between different time steps. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal attention mechanism to focus on the most informative time steps. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed TTC method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% F1-score on all datasets.\n",

We find that LLMs have achieved impressive results in text generation, particularly in applications such as chatbots, summarization, and translation. However, we also identify several limitations, including the lack of diversity, the inability to generate coherent text, and the difficulty of controlling the generated text's tone and style. To address these limitations, we propose several research directions, including the integration of knowledge graphs, the use of multimodal data, and the application of reinforcement learning.\n",

The architecture is built upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the T5 transformer, and is trained on large-scale image-text pairs.

However, it is still an open research question how the choice of prompting strategies affects the performance of fine-tuned PLMs for code generation. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of different prompting strategies on fine-tuned PLMs for code generation, including template-based, task-based, and code-based prompts. We show that the choice of prompting strategy significantly influences the generated code quality and the model's ability to generalize to unseen code. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to improve prompting strategies by fine-tuning a prompt generator on a large dataset of code snippets and corresponding prompts.\n",

This paper aims to compare the performance of several popular pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT) when fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on a benchmark dataset. We also explore the impact of fine-tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, on the performance. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on sentiment analysis leads to substantial improvements in performance compared to the base models. However, the choice of the best performing model depends on the specific dataset and task requirements.

The meta-learner learns a learning algorithm that can be applied to various meta-tasks, while the meta-task learner learns a model for each meta-task using the learned algorithm. The dialogue model generates responses to user inputs based on the learned meta-task models.

We evaluate various multimodal model architectures, including Vision-Language Transformers (VL-T) and Multimodal Transformers (MM-T), on several benchmark datasets, including VisualBERT, LXMERT, and ViLBERT. We find that pre-training significantly improves the performance of these models across all tasks. Furthermore, we identify that VL-T models benefit the most from pre-training compared to MM-T models.

To assist IS research in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text-based IS research. We conducted three case studies in business intelligence using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application across several IS research contexts.

To broaden symbolic methods' applicability and adaptability in the real world, we propose the Meta-Reasoning from a linguistic perspective. This method empowers LLMs to deconstruct reasoning-independent semantic information into generic symbolic representations, thereby efficiently capturing more generalized reasoning knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on more than ten datasets encompassing conventional reasoning tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning, and the more complex interactive reasoning tasks like theory-of-mind reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-Reasoning significantly enhances in-context reasoning accuracy, learning efficiency, out-of-domain generalization, and output stability compared to the Chain-of-Thought technique.

    "        Paper: \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.\"\n",

    "        Title: Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts\n",
    "        Paper: \"While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well they use longer context. We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models.\"\n",

The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks.

The participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group received instruction using an LLM, while the control group received traditional instruction. We used a standardized reading comprehension test to assess the students' performance before and after the intervention.

However, these models are limited by their inability to capture multimodal information and context. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve BERT-based LMs by fusing multimodal information, including text, images, and speech. Our approach utilizes a modality-specific transformer encoder to extract high-level features from each modality and then combines them through a novel fusion layer. We evaluate our approach on several NLP tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of BERT-based LMs. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline models in various tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification.\n",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text-based IS research is currently unclear. To assist IS research in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text-based\n",

However, the lack of annotated data for new tasks and the degradation of performance over time are significant challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning approach that learns to learn new tasks from few-shot examples and adapts to new tasks with minimal forgetting. Our approach combines a few-shot learning algorithm with a memory-based method to store and retrieve knowledge from previous tasks, enabling the model to adapt to new tasks while preserving the knowledge gained from previous tasks. We evaluate our approach on several medical imaging tasks and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both few-shot learning performance and continual learning performance.\n",

SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%\"\n",

    "        Paper: \"In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%\"\n",

    "        Paper: \"The exponential growth of digital content has generated massive textual datasets, necessitating advanced analytical approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text-based Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist IS research in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text-based IS research. We conducted three case studies in business intelligence using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application across several IS research contexts. We also outline potential challenges and limitations in adopting LLMs for IS. By offering a systematic approach and evidence of its utility, our TAISR framework contributes to future IS research streams looking to incorporate powerful LLMs for text analytics.\"\n",

    "        Paper: \"Neural-symbolic methods have demonstrated efficiency in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods mainly rely on syntactically mapping natural languages to complete formal languages like Python and SQL. Those methods require that reasoning tasks be convertible into programs, which cater to the computer execution mindset and deviate from human reasoning habits. To broaden symbolic methods' applicability and adaptability in the real world, we propose the Meta-Reasoning from a linguistic perspective. This method empowers LLMs to deconstruct reasoning-independent semantic information into generic symbolic representations, thereby efficiently capturing more generalized reasoning knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on more than ten datasets encompassing conventional reasoning tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning, and the more complex interactive reasoning tasks like theory-of-mind reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-Reasoning significantly enhances in-context reasoning accuracy, learning efficiency, out-of-domain generalization, and output stability compared to the Chain-of-Thought technique.

    "        Paper: \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.\"\n",

    "        Paper: \"While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well they use longer context. We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models.\"\n",
